Question - What are the techniques to save configuration setting in .NET core?


In .NET Core,
configuration settings are a crucial part of application development,
allowing you to externalize parameters and settings to make your application more flexible and maintainable.

There are various techniques to save and retrieve configuration settings in .NET Core:

appsettings.json File:
    The appsettings.json file is a common way to store configuration settings.
    It's a JSON file where you can define key-value pairs for your configuration settings.
    
    jsonCopy code
    {
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
        }
    },
    "MySettings": {
        "ConnectionString": "your_connection_string",
        "ApiKey": "your_api_key"
    }
    }
    You can then access these settings using the Configuration object in your application.

    csharpCopy code
    var connectionString = Configuration["MySettings:ConnectionString"];

Environment Variables:
    Configuration settings can also be stored in environment variables.
    This is useful for sensitive information that you don't want to store in source code or configuration files.
    
    csharpCopy code
    var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MySettings__ApiKey");
    Here, double underscores are used to represent nested levels in JSON keys.

User Secrets:
    User Secrets is a secure way to store sensitive data during development.
    It is designed for local development and should not be used in production.
    
    bashCopy code
    dotnet user-secrets set "MySettings:ApiKey" "your_api_key"
    In your application, you can access user secrets using the Secret Manager.

Command-Line Arguments:
    You can pass configuration settings through command-line arguments when running your application.
    
    bashCopy code
    dotnet run --MySettings:ApiKey=your_api_key
    Access the values in your code:

    csharpCopy code
    var apiKey = Configuration["MySettings:ApiKey"];

Custom Configuration Providers:
    You can create custom configuration providers to load settings from different sources such as databases, external services,
    or any custom storage.
    
    csharpCopy code
    var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddCustomProvider();
    var configuration = builder.Build();
    Implement IConfigurationProvider to define how the configuration is loaded.

    csharpCopy code
    public class CustomConfigurationProvider : ConfigurationProvider
    {
        public override void Load() => // Load logic
    }

These techniques can be used individually or combined based on the requirements of your application.
The recommended approach is often a combination of appsettings.json for default values,
environment variables for sensitive information, and command-line arguments for runtime configuration.
This provides a good balance between security, flexibility, and ease of use.
