Question - Explain default project structure in ASP.NET core application?


The default project structure in an ASP.NET Core application follows a convention over configuration principle,
providing a well-organized and modular layout for your code.

Below is an explanation of the key components in the default project structure:

wwwroot:
    This folder is used to store static files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc., 
    that should be served directly to clients without any processing by the server.
Controllers:
    This folder contains the controller classes.
    Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, process them, and return appropriate responses.
    Controllers are responsible for the application's behavior.
Views:
    The Views folder contains the Razor view templates (.cshtml files). 
    Views are responsible for rendering HTML and other content that is sent to the client.
    They often work in conjunction with controllers.
Models:
    This folder is where you can define your data models.
    Models represent the data structures used by the application and are often used to interact with databases or other data sources.
Data:
    This folder is sometimes included in the default structure, especially in ASP.NET Core MVC applications. 
    It can contain classes related to data access, such as database context classes for Entity Framework.
Startup.cs:
    This file contains the Startup class, which is the entry point for configuring the ASP.NET Core application.
    It includes methods for configuring services (dependencies) and configuring the request processing pipeline.
appsettings.json:
    This JSON file is used to store configuration settings for the application.
    It can include settings such as database connection strings, API keys, and other configuration parameters.
Program.cs:
    The Program.cs file contains the Main method, which is the entry point for the application. 
    It's responsible for building the web host and starting the application.
Dependencies (Optional):
    If you're using a dependency injection container, the default project structure supports organizing your dependencies in a folder.
    For example, you might have a "Services" folder to keep service classes.
