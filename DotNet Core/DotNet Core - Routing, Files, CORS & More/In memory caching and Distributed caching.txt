Question - What is In-Memory caching & Distributed caching? When to use what?


Caching is a crucial aspect of optimizing performance.

In-Memory Caching:
Definition:
    In-memory caching in ASP.NET Core involves storing data in the application's memory for quick retrieval.
    The cached data is local to a single instance of the application.
Characteristics:
    Scope:  Limited to a single application instance.
            Each instance of the ASP.NET Core application has its own in-memory cache.
    Speed:  Accessing data from in-memory cache is fast because it resides in the application's memory.
Use Cases:
    Suitable for scenarios where data needs to be cached for a short duration.
    Applicable when the cached data is specific to and used within a single instance of the application.

Distributed Caching in ASP.NET Core:
Definition:
    Distributed caching involves storing cached data in a shared cache that can be accessed by multiple instances 
    of an ASP.NET Core application, often running on different servers.
Characteristics:
    Scope:  Shared among multiple instances of an ASP.NET Core application, possibly on different servers. 
            All instances can access and update the same cache.
    Speed:  Accessing data from distributed cache might introduce some latency due to communication between different application
            instances or servers.
Use Cases:
    Ideal for scenarios where cached data needs to be shared among multiple instances of the same ASP.NET Core application.
    Ensures consistency across the application when multiple instances are handling requests.


When to Use In-Memory Caching and Distributed Caching:
In-Memory Caching:
    Single Instance Applications:
        In-memory caching is suitable when your ASP.NET Core application runs on a single server or instance,
        and there's no need to share the cached data across multiple instances.
    Temporary Storage: 
        Appropriate for caching data that is short-lived and doesn't need to be persisted for an extended period.
    Performance Critical Operations:
        Use in-memory caching in scenarios where quick access to data is a higher priority than sharing the cache across multiple instances.

Distributed Caching:
    Load-Balanced Environments:
        Distributed caching is crucial in load-balanced environments where multiple instances of an ASP.NET Core application handle requests.
        It ensures that all instances share the same cache, providing consistency across the application.
    Sharing State:
        When your ASP.NET Core application requires sharing state or data between different instances,
        distributed caching becomes necessary.
    Scalability: 
        For applications that need to scale horizontally by adding more servers, 
        distributed caching allows all instances to access a shared cache, preventing data inconsistencies.

Combining In-Memory and Distributed Caching:
    In practice, ASP.NET Core applications often use a combination of both in-memory and distributed caching.
    For example,
    you might use in-memory caching for local, short-lived data 
    and distributed caching for shared state or data across a load-balanced environment.
    This approach optimizes performance and provides flexibility based on the specific requirements of different parts of the application.
    The ASP.NET Core framework supports various caching mechanisms,
    and you can configure caching providers such as MemoryCache, Redis, or others based on your application's needs.
