Question - What is CORS? Why CORS restriction is required? How to fix CORS error?


Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request
and interact with resources hosted on another domain.
It is a security feature to prevent unauthorized access to resources and protect user data.

Why CORS Restriction is Required:
Same-Origin Policy:
    Browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy,
    which restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

CORS Relaxation:
    It provides a way for servers to declare which origins are allowed to make requests and which HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) 
    are supported.

CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control cross-origin requests.

To fix CORS errors,
the server needs to be configured to include the appropriate CORS headers in the response.
The server specifies which origins are allowed, which methods are supported, and may handle OPTIONS preflight requests.
Proper CORS configuration helps ensure a secure and controlled cross-origin interaction between web pages and servers.
