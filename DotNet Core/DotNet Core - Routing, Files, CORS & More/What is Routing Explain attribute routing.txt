Question - What is Routing? Explain attribute routing in ASP.NET core?


Routing in ASP.NET Core refers to the process of matching incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoint in your application.
An endpoint can be a controller action, a Razor page, or a middleware, and routing determines which code should handle a particular request.

Attribute Routing in ASP.NET Core:
    Attribute routing is a feature in ASP.NET Core that allows developers to define routes directly on controllers and actions using attributes. 
    This provides a more declarative way to define routing, especially useful for RESTful APIs.
