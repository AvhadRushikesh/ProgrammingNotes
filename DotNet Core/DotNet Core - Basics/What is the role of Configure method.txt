Question - What is the role of Configure method?


In an ASP.NET Core application, the Configure method is part of the startup process and is found in the Startup class.
This method is responsible for configuring the request processing pipeline,
which includes setting up middleware components to handle incoming HTTP requests and defining how the application responds to those requests.

Here's a typical structure of the Configure method:
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env) 
    { 
        // Configure the request pipeline. 
    } 

Key responsibilities of the Configure method include:
1. Configuring Middleware:
    The primary purpose of the Configure method is to specify the middleware components that make up the request processing pipeline.
    Middleware components handle various aspects of the request-response cycle,
    such as logging, authentication, authorization, routing, and serving static files.

        app.UseAuthentication();
        app.UseMvc(); 

2. Setting Up Exception Handling:
    Developers often use the Configure method to set up exception handling middleware.
    This middleware catches unhandled exceptions and can be configured to log errors, display error pages, or perform other actions.

3. Defining Routing:
    The Configure method is where the application's routing is defined.
    This includes specifying how URLs are mapped to controllers and actions.

4. Static File Serving:
    If the application serves static files, such as images, stylesheets, or client-side scripts,
    the Configure method is where this is configured.

5. Middleware Order:
    The order in which middleware components are added matters.
    Middleware is executed in the order it is added to the pipeline.
    The Configure method allows developers to specify the order in which middleware should be executed.

6. Custom Middleware Configuration:
    Developers can use the Configure method to set up any custom middleware components or configure existing middleware according to the specific requirements of the application.

The Configure method is called during the application startup process, after the ConfigureServices method.
Together, these methods determine how the application handles incoming requests and produces responses.
The Configure method defines the request processing pipeline,
specifying the sequence of middleware components that participate in processing each request.
