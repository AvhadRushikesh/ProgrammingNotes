Question - What is the role of Program.cs file in ASP.NET Core?


In ASP.NET Core, the Program.cs file plays a crucial role in the application's startup process.
This file is the entry point for the application and contains the Main method,
which serves as the starting point for the application's execution.
The Program.cs file is used to configure the host for the ASP.NET Core application and to set up the initial services and configurations.


Responsibilities of the Program.cs file in an ASP.NET Core application:
1. CreateWebHostBuilder Method:
    The Main method typically calls the CreateWebHostBuilder method, which is responsible for creating an instance of the IWebHostBuilder.
    The IWebHostBuilder is used to configure the web host,
    which includes setting up the server, specifying the startup class, and configuring other aspects of the hosting environment.
2. UseStartup Method:
    The UseStartup method specifies the startup class for the application.
    The startup class contains the configuration for the application's services, middleware, and other components.
    In the example above, the Startup class is specified as the startup class for the application.
3. WebHost Configuration:
    The CreateDefaultBuilder method is often used to configure the default settings for the web host.
    This method sets up configuration, logging, and other aspects of the hosting environment.
    The UseStartup method specifies the startup class to be used for configuring the application.
4. Build and Run:
    Finally, the Build method is called to build the web host, and the Run method is called to start the application.
    This method sequence ensures that the web host is properly configured and initialized before the application starts processing requests.
