Question - What is the difference between .NET core and .NET 5?


.NET Core:
    .NET Core was an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based, and modular applications.
    It was initially developed to be a modular and lightweight platform that could run on various operating systems,
    including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    .NET Core was the successor to the .NET Framework, and it introduced a number of changes, 
    including cross-platform support, a modular design, and a new runtime (CoreCLR).

.NET 5:
    .NET 5 represents a significant shift in the .NET ecosystem.
    Instead of continuing with the separate development of .NET Core and .NET Framework,
    Microsoft decided to unify these frameworks into a single, cohesive platform called .NET 5.
    .NET 5 provides a unified platform that incorporates the best features of both .NET Core and .NET Framework.
    It's important to note that there is no ".NET Core 4" or ".NET Framework 5"â€”.NET 5 is the successor to both.
