Question - What is .NET Core?


.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern, cloud-based, and modular applications.
It is a modular and high-performance framework that can be used to develop a wide range of applications,
including web applications, cloud services, mobile apps, desktop applications, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

Key features of .NET Core include:
Cross-Platform:
    .NET Core is designed to run on various operating systems, 
    including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for developers targeting different platforms.
Open Source:
    The framework is open-source, allowing developers to contribute to its development,
    review its source code, and customize it according to their needs.
Modularity:
    .NET Core is composed of modular and lightweight libraries, making it easy to use only the components needed for a particular application.
    This helps in reducing the overall footprint of the application.
High Performance:
    .NET Core is optimized for performance, providing fast execution and efficient resource utilization.
    It includes features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and a runtime that's designed for speed.
Cross-Language Support:
    Developers can use multiple programming languages, such as C#, F#, and Visual Basic, to build applications on the .NET Core platform.
Unified Platform: 
    With the release of .NET 5, Microsoft has merged the .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single, unified platform,
    simplifying the development process and reducing fragmentation.
Container Support: 
    .NET Core is well-suited for containerized applications,
    and it integrates well with container orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
