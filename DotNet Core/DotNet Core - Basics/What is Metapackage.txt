Question - What is Metapackage? What is the name of Metapackage in ASP.NET core?


A metapackage, in the context of software development and package management,
is a package that doesn't contain any actual code or functionality but serves as a convenient way to group related packages together.
It is essentially a package that depends on other packages, 
allowing developers to easily include a set of related libraries or components with a single reference.
In the context of ASP.NET Core, the metapackage that serves this purpose is known as the "Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" metapackage.
This metapackage simplifies dependency management by bundling together a set of commonly used and recommended packages for building
ASP.NET Core web applications.
Instead of explicitly referencing each individual package,
developers can reference the "Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" metapackage to get a predefined set of dependencies.
