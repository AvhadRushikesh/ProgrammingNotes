Question - What is the role of ConfigureServices method?


In an ASP.NET Core application, the ConfigureServices method is part of the startup process and is found in the Startup class.
This method is responsible for configuring the services that the application will use.
Services in ASP.NET Core are components that provide functionality to the application, such as data access, logging, authentication, and more.

The ConfigureServices method takes an IServiceCollection parameter, which is a collection of service descriptors.
Service descriptors define the services and their lifetimes within the application.

Here's a typical structure of the ConfigureServices method:
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) 
    { 
        // Configure and add services to the service collection. 
    } 

Key responsibilities of the ConfigureServices method include:
1. Dependency Injection Configuration:
    The method is used to configure dependency injection for the application.
    It specifies how services should be instantiated and injected into components such as controllers, middleware, and other parts of the application.
2. Adding Services to the Service Collection:
    Developers use the services parameter to add services to the service collection.
    This is done using methods like AddTransient, AddScoped, and AddSingleton.
    The choice of these methods depends on how long the service instance should live
    (transient, scoped to the request, or a singleton throughout the application's lifetime).
3. Configuration of Options:
    Some services may have configurable options.
    The ConfigureServices method is a common place to bind configuration settings to options classes and register them with the service collection.
4. Adding MVC and Other Framework Services:
    If the application uses ASP.NET Core MVC or other framework-specific services, they are often added in the ConfigureServices method.
    For example, adding MVC services can be done using:
        
        services.AddMvc(); 

5. Adding Authentication and Authorization Services:
    Configuration of authentication and authorization services, if used in the application, is often done in the ConfigureServices method.
    This may include specifying authentication schemes, adding identity services, and configuring authorization policies.

        services.AddAuthentication().AddJwtBearer(); 

6. Custom Service Configuration:
    Developers can add custom services or configure third-party services required for the application.
    This is the place where the application's service composition is defined.

The ConfigureServices method is called during the application startup,
and it sets up the foundation for the application by defining the services it will use.
This method is complementary to the Configure method,
which is responsible for configuring middleware and the application's request processing pipeline.
Together, these methods provide the necessary configuration for an ASP.NET Core application to run successfully.
