Question - What are the advantages of .NET core over .NET framework?


Cross-Platform Support:
    .NET Core is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    This is particularly valuable for applications targeting a variety of environments, including cloud services and containers.
Open Source:
    .NET Core is fully open source, and its development is conducted in the open on GitHub.
    This transparency allows developers to contribute to the framework, review its source code, and customize it for their needs.
Modularity:
    .NET Core is modular, allowing developers to include only the necessary components for their applications.
    This modularity reduces the size of deployed applications and enhances performance.
Performance:
    .NET Core is optimized for performance.
    It includes features such as the CoreCLR runtime and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation,
    resulting in faster execution and improved resource utilization.
Unified Platform:
    With the introduction of .NET 5 and later versions, Microsoft has merged the best features of .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single,
    unified platform.
    This helps in reducing fragmentation and simplifying the development process.
Container Support:
    .NET Core is well-suited for containerized applications.
    It can be easily deployed using containerization tools like Docker,
    making it a good fit for microservices architectures and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
Side-by-Side Versioning:
    .NET Core allows for side-by-side versioning, meaning that multiple versions of the runtime can coexist on the same machine.
    This is useful for applications that require specific versions of the framework.
Command-Line Interface (CLI):
    .NET Core comes with a command-line interface (CLI) that facilitates development, build, and deployment processes.
    This can be particularly beneficial for automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
Modern Language Features:
    .NET Core supports modern language features,
    providing developers with access to the latest advancements in C# and other supported languages.
Community and Ecosystem:
    The open-source nature of .NET Core has led to a vibrant and active community.
    This has resulted in a growing ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that can be used in conjunction with .NET Core.
