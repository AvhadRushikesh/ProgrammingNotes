Question - How to implement Dependency Injection in .NET core?


In .NET Core, dependency injection is built into the framework, and it's an integral part of the application's design.
.NET Core provides a lightweight, built-in IoC (Inversion of Control) container that makes it easy to register and resolve dependencies.

Here's how you can implement dependency injection in a .NET Core application:
1. Create Services:
    Define the services and interfaces that your application will use.
2. Configure Dependency Injection in Startup.cs:
    In the Startup.cs file, you configure the services and their implementations in the ConfigureServices method:
3. Use Dependency Injection in Controllers:
    You can then use dependency injection in your controllers, services, or other components that are managed by the .NET Core framework.
    For example, in a controller:

Note:
    .NET Core's DI container automatically resolves dependencies and injects them into the constructor or properties.
    It's also possible to use constructor injection in middleware, filters, and other components.

        If you are working with Razor Pages, you can use constructor injection in your PageModel:

Lifetime of Services: 
    Choose the appropriate lifetime for your services based on your application's requirements.
    Common lifetimes are transient, scoped, and singleton.

    AddTransient:
        A new instance is created every time the service is requested.
    AddScoped:
        A single instance is created per scope (typically per HTTP request).
    AddSingleton:
        A single instance is created and shared throughout the application.

Configuration Bindings:
    You can use the Configure method to bind configuration sections to strongly typed options.
    This can be useful for injecting configuration settings into your services.

With these steps, you've set up a basic dependency injection system in a .NET Core application.
The built-in container is often sufficient for many applications, 
but you can also use third-party IoC containers if you have more advanced requirements.
