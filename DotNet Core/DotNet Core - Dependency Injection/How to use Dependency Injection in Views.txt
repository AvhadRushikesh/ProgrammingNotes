Question - How to use Dependency Injection in Views in ASP.NET Core?


In ASP.NET Core, dependency injection is typically used to inject services into controllers, middleware, 
or other components during the request processing pipeline.
However, in views, dependency injection is more indirect, as views themselves are not directly injected with dependencies.

To use dependency injection in views in ASP.NET Core,
you can leverage the @inject directive to declare and use services directly within the view. 

Here's a step-by-step guide to use the Dependency Injection in Views:
1. Register the Service:
    Ensure that the service you want to use in the view is registered with the dependency injection container in the Startup.cs file,
    in the ConfigureServices method.
2. Inject the Service in the View:
    In your view file (e.g., a Razor view file with the extension .cshtml), use the @inject directive to inject the service.
    You'll typically place this at the top of the view file, outside the HTML tags.
3. Use the Injected Service in the View:
    Now, you can use the injected service within the view.

Remember that while this approach allows you to use dependency injection in views,
it's generally advisable to keep views focused on presentation logic and delegate complex logic to controllers or services.
If the logic in your view becomes too complex, it might be a sign that some of it should be moved to a controller or service.
