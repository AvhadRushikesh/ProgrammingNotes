Question - What is AddSingleton, AddScoped and AddTransient method?


In ASP.NET Core dependency injection, 
AddSingleton, AddScoped, and AddTransient are methods used to register services with the dependency injection container. 
These methods define the lifetime of the service instances,
determining how long each instance is kept in the container and when it is created or disposed.

1. AddSingleton:
    A single instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application.
    It is created the first time it's requested and reused for subsequent requests.
2. AddScoped:
    A new instance of the service is created for each scope.
    In the context of a web application, a scope is often equivalent to a single HTTP request.
3. AddTransient:
    A new instance of the service is created each time it's requested. 
    There is no reuse of instances.
