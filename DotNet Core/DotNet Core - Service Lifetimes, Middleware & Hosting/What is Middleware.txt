Question - What is Middleware in ASP.NET core? What is custom middleware?


In ASP.NET Core, middleware is a software component that is added to the application pipeline to process requests and responses.
Middleware components are executed in a sequence, and each component in the pipeline performs a specific function.
The middleware pipeline in ASP.NET Core allows developers to handle HTTP requests and responses at various stages of the request processing.

Custom Middleware:
Custom middleware provides flexibility to developers, 
allowing them to inject their own logic at specific points in the request processing pipeline.
This can include tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, and more.
