Question - What are the types of Hosting in ASP.NET core? What is In process and Out?


In ASP.NET Core, 
hosting refers to the process of deploying and running your application.
There are two main types of hosting in ASP.NET Core:
In-process hosting and Out-of-process hosting.

In-process Hosting:
    Also known as "in-process" hosting or "IIS hosting."
    In this type of hosting, the ASP.NET Core application runs within the IIS worker process (w3wp.exe on Windows) alongside the IIS server.
    It is the traditional hosting model used with earlier versions of ASP.NET.
    In-process hosting is achieved using the AspNetCoreModule in IIS, which forwards requests to the ASP.NET Core application.
    
    
Out-of-process Hosting:
    Also known as "out-of-process" hosting or "self-hosting."
    In this type of hosting, the ASP.NET Core application runs in its own process independent of the web server (e.g., Kestrel server).
    Out-of-process hosting is the default hosting model for ASP.NET Core applications.
    It provides more flexibility and scalability as the application can be hosted using various servers, including Kestrel,
    without relying on a specific web server like IIS.

Kestrel:
    Kestrel is a cross-platform, lightweight web server developed by the ASP.NET team.
    It is used as the default server for out-of-process hosting.
    Even when using out-of-process hosting with IIS, requests are first received by the IIS server,
    which then forwards them to the Kestrel server.

In summary, 
in-process hosting involves running the ASP.NET Core application within the IIS worker process,
while out-of-process hosting involves running the application in its own independent process,
often using the Kestrel web server.
Out-of-process hosting is the preferred choice for new ASP.NET Core applications due to its flexibility and cross-platform support.
