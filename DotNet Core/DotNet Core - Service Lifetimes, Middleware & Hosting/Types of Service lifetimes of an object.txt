Question - What are the types of Service Lifetimes of an object / instance in ASP.NET?


In ASP.NET Core, services are registered with different lifetimes, specifying how long an instance of a service should live.
The service lifetime affects how instances are created and managed by the dependency injection container.

The three main types of service lifetimes in ASP.NET Core are:
Transient:
    Transient services are created each time they are requested.
    A new instance is provided for every request for the service.
    Transient services are suitable for lightweight, stateless services where a new instance for each request is not a problem.
    
    Example:
        A service that generates a unique identifier for each request.

Scoped:
    Scoped services are created once per request within the scope of the request.
    This means that the same instance is reused within a single HTTP request, but different requests will have different instances.
    Scoped services are often used for components that need to maintain state for the duration of a request.
    Use scoped services for components that maintain state for the duration of a request.
    
    Example:
        A service that tracks user information within a specific HTTP request.

Singleton:
    Singleton services are created once and reused throughout the application's lifetime.
    The same instance is provided for every request.
    Singleton services are suitable for stateless or thread-safe services that can be shared across the application.
    
    Example:
        A service that provides configuration settings for the entire application.
