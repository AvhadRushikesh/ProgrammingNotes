Question - How ASP.NET Core Middleware is different from HttpModule?


ASP.NET Core Middleware provides a more flexible, composable, and cross-platform approach to building request processing pipelines.
It is designed to work well with the modern features of the .NET ecosystem, including dependency injection and asynchronous programming.
On the other hand, HttpModules are part of the legacy ASP.NET framework,
tightly tied to System.Web, and are not as versatile or testable as ASP.NET Core Middleware.
When building new applications or migrating existing ones to ASP.NET Core,
the use of Middleware is recommended for taking advantage of the improved architecture and features provided by the ASP.NET Core framework.

ASP.NET Core Middleware:
Cross-Platform and Cross-Framework:
    ASP.NET Core Middleware is designed to be cross-platform and cross-framework.
    It can run on multiple operating systems, and it is not tied to the System.Web infrastructure, making it more versatile and lightweight.
Dependency Injection:
    Middleware components in ASP.NET Core can take advantage of the built-in dependency injection system.
    This enables better testability, modular design, and easier management of dependencies compared to HttpModules.
Flexible Configuration:
    Middleware can be easily configured in the Startup.cs file using the Configure method.
    The order of middleware components can be specified, and individual components can be added or removed with ease.
Composable:
    Middleware components are composable and can be combined to build complex request processing pipelines.
    This makes it easier to organize and reuse functionality across different parts of an application.
Async Support:
    ASP.NET Core Middleware fully supports asynchronous programming.
    Middleware components can be asynchronous, allowing for more efficient use of resources, especially in scenarios with high concurrency.

ASP.NET HttpModule:
Tied to System.Web:
    HttpModules are specific to the ASP.NET System.Web infrastructure.
    They are part of the ASP.NET pipeline in the traditional ASP.NET framework and are tightly coupled to the HttpContext and other System.Web components.
Limited Testability:
    Due to the tight integration with the HttpContext and other static classes, HttpModules can be challenging to unit test.
    This can make it more difficult to achieve the same level of test coverage compared to ASP.NET Core Middleware.
Configuration in Web.config:
    Configuration for HttpModules is often done in the web.config file.
    This centralized configuration can be less flexible compared to the programmatic configuration available in ASP.NET Core Startup.cs.
Synchronous Execution:
    HttpModules execute synchronously in the request pipeline.
    While this is suitable for many scenarios, it may lead to less optimal resource utilization, especially in scenarios with high concurrency.
Limited Cross-Framework Support:
    HttpModules are specific to the ASP.NET framework and are not easily portable to other frameworks or platforms.
