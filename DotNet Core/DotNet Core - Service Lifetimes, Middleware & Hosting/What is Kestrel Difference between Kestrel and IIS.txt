Question - What is Kestrel? What is the difference between Kestrel and IIS?


Kestrel:
Kestrel is a cross-platform, open-source web server developed by the ASP.NET team at Microsoft.
It is designed to be a lightweight and fast web server that can be used to host ASP.NET Core applications.
Kestrel is the default web server for ASP.NET Core applications and can be used for both in-process and out-of-process hosting.

Key features of Kestrel include:
Cross-Platform:
    Kestrel is cross-platform and can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
    This makes it suitable for hosting ASP.NET Core applications on a variety of operating systems.
Performance: 
    Kestrel is designed with performance in mind.
    It is optimized for handling a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
Integration:
    While Kestrel can be used as a standalone server, it is often used in combination with a reverse proxy server
    (like Nginx or IIS) when hosting production ASP.NET Core applications to handle tasks such as load balancing and SSL termination.


Difference Between Kestrel and IIS:
Hosting Model:
Kestrel: 
    It is a standalone web server and can be used for both in-process and out-of-process hosting.
    It is the default server for ASP.NET Core applications.
IIS (Internet Information Services):
    IIS is a web server created by Microsoft and is traditionally used to host ASP.NET applications.
    In ASP.NET Core, IIS can be used for in-process hosting, where the ASP.NET Core application runs within the IIS worker process.

Platform Compatibility:
Kestrel: 
    Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
IIS: 
    Primarily used on Windows, though there are ways to use it in combination with reverse proxy servers for broader platform support.

Performance:
Kestrel:
    Optimized for performance and is particularly well-suited for handling a large number of concurrent connections.
IIS:
    While IIS is a robust and feature-rich server, Kestrel is often used in conjunction with IIS for improved performance.

Use Cases:
Kestrel:
    Suitable for standalone use or behind a reverse proxy server. 
    Commonly used in out-of-process hosting scenarios.
IIS: 
    Commonly used for in-process hosting, where the ASP.NET Core application runs within the IIS worker process.

In many production scenarios, Kestrel is used as the primary web server, and IIS (or another reverse proxy server) is used
as a reverse proxy to handle tasks such as load balancing, SSL termination, and serving static files.
This combination provides a flexible and high-performance hosting solution for ASP.NET Core applications.
