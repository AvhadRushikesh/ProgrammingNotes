Question - What is Run(), Use() and Map() method?


In ASP.NET Core, Run(), Use(), and Map() are methods used to configure middleware in the application's request processing pipeline.
Each method plays a specific role in defining how the application should handle incoming HTTP requests.
1. Run() Method: 
    The Run() method is used to add a terminal middleware to the pipeline.
    A terminal middleware is a component that doesn't call the next delegate, meaning it doesn't pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline.
2. Use() Method:
    The Use() method is a versatile method that can be used to add middleware components to the pipeline.
    Middleware added with Use() can perform actions such as processing requests, modifying responses, or passing control to the next middleware.
3. Map() Method:
    The Map() method is used to conditionally branch the request pipeline based on the request's path.
    It allows you to map specific middleware to handle requests with certain paths.
