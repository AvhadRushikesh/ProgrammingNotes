Question - What are Behavioral design pattern?


Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects.
These patterns define the patterns of communication between classes or objects, specifying how they collaborate to accomplish a common task.
Behavioral patterns abstract the ways in which objects collaborate and communicate, making the system more flexible and extensible.

Here are some common behavioral design patterns:
Observer Pattern:
    Intent:
        Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
        all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    Use Case:
        When an object (the subject) needs to notify other objects (observers) about changes without knowing who or what those observers are.
Strategy Pattern:
    Intent:
        Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
        Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
    Use Case:
        When you want to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable.
        Clients can choose an algorithm at runtime.
Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
    Intent:
        Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
        Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
    Use Case:
        When you want to decouple senders and receivers of a request, and more than one object may handle a request.
Command Pattern:
    Intent:
        Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests,
        queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters.
    Use Case:
        When you want to parameterize objects with operations, queue operations, or support undoable operations.
Interpreter Pattern:
    Intent:
        Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions.
        It defines a grammar for the language and an interpreter that interprets sentences in the language.
    Use Case:
        When you have a language to interpret, and you can represent statements in the language as abstract syntax trees.
Iterator Pattern:
    Intent:
        Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    Use Case:
        When you want to provide a consistent way to traverse different collections of objects without exposing their internal details.
Mediator Pattern:
    Intent:
        Defines an object that centralizes communication between objects in a system.
        It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
    Use Case:
        When you want to reduce direct dependencies between communicating objects and centralize control and communication logic.
Memento Pattern:
    Intent:
        Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
    Use Case:
        When you need to capture and restore an object's internal state, such as for undo mechanisms.
State Pattern:
    Intent: 
        Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
        The object will appear to change its class.
    Use Case:
        When the behavior of an object depends on its state, and the object must change its behavior at runtime.
Visitor Pattern:
    Intent:
        Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
        It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
    Use Case:
        When you have a complex structure of objects,
        and you want to perform various operations on these objects without modifying their classes.

These behavioral design patterns provide solutions to problems related to the communication and collaboration between objects.
They contribute to the development of flexible and maintainable software systems by promoting loose coupling and encapsulating 
the variability in behavior.
