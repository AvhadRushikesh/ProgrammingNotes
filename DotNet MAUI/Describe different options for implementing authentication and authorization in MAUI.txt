Question - Describe the different options for implementing authentication and authorization in .NET MAUI applications.


.NET MAUI offers various options for implementing authentication and authorization in applications:

1.  Microsoft Identity Platform:
    Utilize the platformâ€™s libraries, such as MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library),
    to authenticate users with Azure Active Directory or other identity providers.
2.  OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect:
    Implement third-party authentication using standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect,
    supported by popular identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
3.  ASP.NET Core Identity:
    Integrate with an existing ASP.NET Core backend that uses its built-in Identity system for user 
    management, authentication, and authorization.
4.  Custom Authentication:
    Develop a custom solution tailored to specific requirements, 
    including token-based authentication, API keys, or other proprietary mechanisms.
5.  Device-Based Biometrics:
    Leverage device-specific biometric features, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, 
    to enhance security and user experience.
6.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    Define roles and permissions within the application to control access to resources based on user roles.
7.  Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
    Apply fine-grained policies using attributes of users, actions, and resources to determine access rights dynamically.
