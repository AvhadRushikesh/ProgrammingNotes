Question - Explain the concept of multi-targetting in .NET MAUI and how it improves the development process for cross-platform applications.


Multi-targeting in .NET MAUI refers to the ability to develop cross-platform applications targeting multiple platforms,
such as Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, using a single codebase.
This is achieved through shared projects and platform-specific implementations.

.NET MAUI simplifies the development process by providing a unified framework for creating user interfaces, 
accessing native APIs, and sharing common logic across platforms.
Developers can leverage Xamarin.Forms controls and new handlers to customize UI elements while maintaining consistency.

The multi-targeting approach reduces code duplication, streamlines maintenance, and accelerates app updates.
It also enables seamless integration with modern tools like Visual Studio, Hot Reload, and C# 9 features,
enhancing productivity and collaboration among teams.
