Question - Explain the concept of custom controls in .NET MAUI, and describe how to create a custom control from scratch for a real-world scenario.


Custom controls in .NET MAUI are user-defined, reusable UI components that extend existing controls or create new ones to meet specific requirements.
They enhance code maintainability and consistency across applications.

To create a custom control from scratch, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new class inheriting from an appropriate base class (e.g., View) or an existing control.
2.  Define properties for customization using BindableProperty.
3.  Override methods like OnMeasure, ArrangeChildren, etc., for layout management.
4.  Implement rendering logic by overriding Draw method or creating platform-specific renderers.
5.  Register the renderer with ExportRenderer attribute if needed.
6.  Use the custom control in XAML or C# code.

For example, consider creating a circular progress bar:
1.  Inherit from View:
    public class CircularProgress : View { }
2.  Add bindable properties: 
    public static readonly BindableProperty ProgressProperty = ...
3.  Override OnMeasure for size calculation.
4.  Create platform-specific renderers, 
    e.g., CircularProgressRenderer for Android/iOS.
5.  Register renderers:
    [assembly: ExportRenderer(typeof(CircularProgress), typeof(CircularProgressRenderer))]
6.  Use it in XAML:
    <local:CircularProgress Progress="{Binding Value}" />
