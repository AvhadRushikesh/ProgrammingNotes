Question - How does .NET MAUI differ from Xamarin.Forms?


.NET MAUI is the next evolution of Xamarin.Forms,
building upon its foundation and addressing its limitations.
It introduces several improvements and enhancements, including a simplified API,
improved performance, and a more streamlined development experience.
Additionally, .NET MAUI offers a smoother migration path for existing Xamarin.Forms projects,
allowing developers to leverage their existing codebase.


.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) and Xamarin.Forms are related frameworks for building cross-platform mobile and desktop applications using
the .NET development stack.
While .NET MAUI builds upon Xamarin.Forms,
there are key differences and improvements in .NET MAUI that make it a more versatile and powerful framework.

Here are some of the main differences:
Unified API Surface:
    Xamarin.Forms had some differences in APIs and capabilities across platforms, which could lead to platform-specific code in certain scenarios.
    .NET MAUI introduces a truly unified API surface, providing a consistent set of APIs for building applications across multiple platforms.
    This means developers can use a single codebase without worrying about significant platform variations.
Single Project Structure:
    Xamarin.Forms projects typically required separate projects for each platform (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.),
    leading to a more complex project structure.
    In contrast, .NET MAUI simplifies this by supporting a single project structure for multiple platforms.
    Developers can manage their code in a single project file, making it easier to maintain and reducing the overhead of managing multiple projects.
Native Controls and Renderers:
    While Xamarin.Forms used a rendering mechanism to display controls on different platforms,
    .NET MAUI introduces a more native and direct use of platform-specific controls.
    This results in improved performance and better adherence to each platform's design guidelines.
.NET 6 Integration:
    .NET MAUI is built on top of .NET 6, the latest long-term support (LTS) version of the .NET platform.
    This ensures that developers can leverage the latest features, performance improvements, and language enhancements provided by .NET 6.
Blazor Integration:
    .NET MAUI supports the integration of Blazor, allowing developers to build hybrid applications that share code between web and
    mobile/desktop versions.
    This enables the use of C# and .NET for both web and native application development.
Performance Improvements:
    .NET MAUI includes performance improvements over Xamarin.Forms,
    resulting in faster startup times, improved runtime performance, and a more responsive user experience.
Hot Reload:
    While Xamarin.Forms had a Live Reload feature,
    .NET MAUI introduces Hot Reload, a more advanced feature that allows developers to see code changes immediately during development without
    restarting the application. 
    This speeds up the development and testing process.
Desktop Application Support:
    .NET MAUI extends its support beyond mobile platforms to include desktop platforms such as Windows and macOS.
    Developers can use a single codebase to target a broader range of devices.
Enhanced Theming:
    .NET MAUI provides enhanced theming capabilities,
    allowing developers to create consistent and visually appealing user interfaces across platforms.
    The framework leverages platform-specific styling to ensure a native look and feel.
Community and Future Development:
    .NET MAUI represents the next evolution in cross-platform application development within the .NET ecosystem.
    It benefits from the lessons learned and feedback received from Xamarin.Forms,
    and it is actively developed and supported by Microsoft and the community.

In summary,
.NET MAUI builds on the foundation of Xamarin.Forms,
addressing limitations and introducing new features to provide a more unified, performant,
and versatile framework for building cross-platform applications.
Developers familiar with Xamarin.Forms will find many concepts and patterns carried over to .NET MAUI,
making the transition smoother while enjoying the benefits of the improvements introduced in the new framework.
