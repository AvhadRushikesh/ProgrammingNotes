Question - Discuss how the .NET MAUI framework supports different platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows and macOS.
What are the pros and cons of using a single cross-platform framework like .NET MAUI?


.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a cross-platform framework that simplifies the development of native applications for 
iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.
It achieves this by providing a single codebase with shared UI components and platform-specific APIs.

Pros:
1. Code Reusability:
    Developers can write once and run on multiple platforms, reducing time and effort.
2. Consistency:
    Shared UI components ensure consistent user experience across devices.
3. Easier Maintenance:
    Single codebase simplifies updates and bug fixes.
4. Large Developer Community:
    .NET ecosystem offers extensive resources and support.

Cons:
1. Performance:
    Cross-platform frameworks may have slightly lower performance compared to native apps due to abstraction layers.
2. Limited Access to Native Features:
    Some platform-specific features might not be available or require additional workarounds.
3. Dependency on Framework Updates:
    Developers must wait for .NET MAUI updates to access new OS features.
