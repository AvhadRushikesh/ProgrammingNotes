Question - Explain the concept of "Shell" in .NET MAUI and how it helps to simplify app navigation and improve overall performance.


Shell in .NET MAUI is a container for app architecture, streamlining navigation and enhancing performance.
It unifies visual structure, top-level navigation, and common UI features into one component.
By consolidating these elements, Shell simplifies the creation of complex hierarchical structures and reduces boilerplate code.
Developers can define flyout menus, tab bars, and URI-based routing with ease, improving maintainability and readability.
Performance benefits stem from built-in optimizations like intelligent caching and on-demand rendering.
This ensures smooth transitions between pages while minimizing resource consumption.
