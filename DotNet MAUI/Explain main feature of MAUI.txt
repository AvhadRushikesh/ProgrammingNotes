.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a cross-platform framework for building native UIs on various platforms.
It extends Xamarin.Forms, providing improved features and capabilities:

1. Single Project Experience: 
    Simplifies app development by consolidating platform-specific projects into one.
2. New Handler Architecture:
    Replaces renderers with handlers, improving performance and customization.
3. Enhanced MVU Support:
    Supports Model-View-Update pattern alongside MVVM, offering flexibility in coding styles.
4. Improved Tooling:
    Offers better design-time experiences like Hot Reload and Live Visual Tree.

Differences from Xamarin.Forms:
1. Consolidated project structure reduces complexity.
2. Better performance due to handler architecture.
3. Additional support for MVU(Model-View-Update) pattern.
4. Enhanced developer experience through improved tooling.
