Question - Describe how live reloading and hot-reloading can speed up the development process and improve overall efficiency in .NET MAUI


Live reloading and hot-reloading in .NET MAUI significantly enhance development efficiency by allowing developers to see the impact of their 
code changes instantly.
Live reloading automatically refreshes the applicationâ€™s UI when XAML or C# files are modified,
eliminating the need for manual rebuilds and restarts.
This accelerates iterative design and debugging processes.

Hot-reloading takes it a step further by injecting new code into the running app without restarting it,
preserving the current state and navigation stack.
This feature is particularly beneficial when working on complex applications with deep navigation hierarchies,
as it saves time navigating back to the modified screen after each change.

Both techniques reduce context-switching and improve developer focus,
leading to faster development cycles and higher overall productivity in .NET MAUI projects.
