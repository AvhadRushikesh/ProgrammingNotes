Question - Explain the uses of control templates, data templates, and styles in .NET MAUI, and how they can help in enhancing the user interface of an application.


Control templates
    Control templates in .NET MAUI define the visual structure of a control, allowing customization while maintaining functionality.
    Control templates help create custom controls without losing core features, ensuring a unique yet functional UI.

Data templates
    Data templates determine how data is displayed within controls like ListView and CollectionView, enabling consistent presentation across items.
    Data templates enable developers to display complex data structures with ease, enhancing user experience through organized content presentation.

Styles
    Styles provide a way to apply reusable property settings to multiple controls for a uniform appearance.
    Styles promote consistency and maintainability by centralizing property values, simplifying UI updates.


Using these tools together allows for efficient UI development, improved aesthetics, and better user experiences in .NET MAUI applications.
