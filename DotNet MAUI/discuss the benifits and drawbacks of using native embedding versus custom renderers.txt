Question - In the context of .NET MAUI, discuss the benifits and drawbacks of using native embedding versus custom renderers.
Provide examples to illustrate your points.


.NET MAUI offers two approaches for platform-specific UI customization:
native embedding and custom renderers. 
Each has its benefits and drawbacks.

Native embedding allows developers to include native controls directly in the shared code, improving code reusability and maintainability.
It simplifies integration with existing native libraries and provides a more consistent look and feel across platforms. 
For example:
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml">
  <Label Text="Hello, World!" />
  <ios:UISwitch x:DataType="x:Boolean" />
</ContentPage>

However, native embedding can lead to increased complexity when handling events or data binding, 
as it requires additional code to bridge between .NET MAUI and native APIs.

Custom renderers offer greater control over rendering and behavior of controls by subclassing and overriding methods.
This enables fine-grained customization and better performance optimization.
Example:
public class CustomEntryRenderer : EntryRenderer
{
    protected override void OnElementChanged(ElementChangedEventArgs<Entry> e)
    {
        base.OnElementChanged(e);
        if (Control != null)
        {
            /* Customize native control */ 
        }
    }
}

Drawbacks of custom renderers include increased code complexity and potential maintenance challenges due to platform-specific implementations.
