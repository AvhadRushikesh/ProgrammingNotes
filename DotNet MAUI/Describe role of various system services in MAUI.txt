Question - Describe the role of various system services in .NET MAUI, such as the Dependency Service, Messaging Center and Font Registrar.


.NET MAUI system services facilitate communication and resource management within the application.

Dependency Service enables decoupling of platform-specific implementations from shared code,
allowing injection of native functionality into shared classes.
It simplifies cross-platform development by providing a single API for accessing platform-specific features.

Messaging Center allows loosely-coupled communication between components without direct references, enabling event-driven architecture.
Components can subscribe to messages and respond accordingly when published, promoting separation of concerns and reducing dependencies.

Font Registrar manages custom fonts registration, streamlining font usage across platforms.
By registering fonts with aliases, developers can reference them consistently in shared code, ensuring uniform appearance on all target platforms.
