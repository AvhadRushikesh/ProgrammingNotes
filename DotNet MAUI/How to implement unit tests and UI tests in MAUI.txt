Question - Decribe how to implement unit tests and UI tests in .NET MAUI, and discuss the importance of testing in cross-platform applications.


In .NET MAUI,
implement unit tests using xUnit or NUnit testing frameworks.
Create a separate test project, reference the main project, and write test methods with appropriate assertions.
For UI tests, use Xamarin.UITest framework, which supports both Android and iOS platforms.
Write Page Object Model (POM) classes to interact with UI elements and create test scenarios.

Testing is crucial in cross-platform applications for several reasons:
1.  Ensures consistent behavior across platforms.
2.  Detects platform-specific issues early.
3.  Validates code sharing efficiency.
4.  Facilitates maintainability and extensibility.
5.  Improves overall application quality and user experience.
