Question - What are the difference between LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework?


LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework are both technologies in the .NET ecosystem that provide ORM capabilities,
allowing developers to interact with databases using an object-oriented approach.

However, they differ in various aspects, including their design, features, and use cases.

LINQ to SQL was designed primarily for a lightweight ORM solution and focuses on simplicity and ease of use.

Entity Framework is a more comprehensive ORM framework designed to address a broader range of scenarios,
including complex mapping and more advanced features.
