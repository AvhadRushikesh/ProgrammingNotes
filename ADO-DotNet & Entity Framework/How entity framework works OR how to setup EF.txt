Question - How entity framework works? Or how to setup EF?


How Entity Framework Works:
1. Entity Data Model:
    EF uses an Entity Data Model (EDM) to represent the database schema in terms of conceptual entities and their relationships.
    The EDM is typically defined using the Entity Data Model Designer in Visual Studio or by writing code-first classes that map to the database schema.

2. DbContext:
    DbContext is a central class in EF that represents a session with the database.
    It is responsible for tracking changes to entities, managing connections, and coordinating interactions with the underlying database.
    Developers create a class derived from DbContext that contains DbSet properties representing the entities to be persisted in the database.

3.LINQ to Entities:
    Developers can use Language Integrated Query (LINQ) to query and manipulate data in the database using EF.
    LINQ queries are translated by EF into SQL queries that are executed against the database.

4.Change Tracking:
    EF tracks changes made to entities during their lifespan within a DbContext.
    Changes include entity creations, modifications, and deletions.

5.Database Initialization:
    EF can initialize the database based on the EDM. This includes creating tables, relationships, and other database artifacts.
    Initialization strategies can be code-first migrations, model-first generation, or database-first reverse engineering.


Setting Up Entity Framework:
    Setting up Entity Framework involves several steps,
    and the exact process can vary depending on whether you are using a database-first, model-first, or code-first approach.    
Here's a basic guide for code-first, which is a common approach:
1.Install Entity Framework NuGet Package:
    Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
    Install the Entity Framework NuGet package using command.

2.Create DbContext Class:
    Create a class derived from DbContext that represents your database context. 
    Define DbSet properties for each entity you want to persist.

3.Configure Connection String:
    Add a connection string in the appsettings.json file or the Web.config file, specifying the database provider, server, and database name.

4.Register DbContext:
    In your application's startup configuration (typically Startup.cs), register your DbContext in the dependency injection container.

5.Run Migrations (Optional for Code-First):
    If you are using code-first, run migrations to create or update the database schema based on your code.

6.Use DbContext in Your Application:
    Finally, use the DbContext in your application to interact with the database.


This is a basic setup for Entity Framework using the code-first approach.
Depending on your requirements and preferences, you may choose other approaches, such as database-first or model-first,
and configure EF accordingly.
