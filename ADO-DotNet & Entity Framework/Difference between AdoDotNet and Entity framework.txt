Question - How will you differentiate ADO.NET From Entity Framework?


ADO.NET:
    ADO.NET is a lower-level data access technology that provides a set of classes for interacting directly with databases.
    Requires more manual coding for tasks like opening/closing connections,
    writing SQL queries, and mapping data between database and application objects.

Entity Framework:
    Entity Framework is a higher-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that abstracts the underlying database structure,
    allowing developers to work with database entities as .NET objects.
    Developers interact with a more abstracted model, such as DbContext and entity classes.
