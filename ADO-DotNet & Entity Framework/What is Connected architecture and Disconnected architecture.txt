Question - What is Connected architecture and Disconnected architecture?


Connected Architecture: 
    In a connected architecture, the application maintains a continuous connection to the database throughout its execution. 
    The connection is opened when data needs to be fetched or updated, and it remains open until the data-related operations are completed.

Disconnected Architecture: 
    In a disconnected architecture, the application connects to the database, retrieves the required data, and then disconnects from the database.
    Once the data is retrieved, the application works with the data locally without maintaining an active connection to the database.
