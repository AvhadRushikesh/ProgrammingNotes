Question - What is Entity Framework?


Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications.
It simplifies the process of interacting with relational databases by allowing developers to work with database objects in a more natural,
object-oriented way.
Entity Framework is part of the Microsoft .NET ecosystem and is commonly used in conjunction with ASP.NET for building data-driven web applications.
