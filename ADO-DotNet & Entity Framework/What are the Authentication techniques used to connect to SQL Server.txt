Question - What are the Authentication techniques used to connect to SQL Server?


SQL Server supports various authentication techniques to connect to a database.
The two primary authentication modes are Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication.

1. Windows Authentication (Integrated Security):
    Windows Authentication, also known as Integrated Security, relies on the Windows operating system to authenticate users.
    Users connect to SQL Server using their Windows credentials, and SQL Server validates these credentials against the Windows domain.

2. SQL Server Authentication (Username and Password):
    SQL Server Authentication requires users to provide a username and password directly to SQL Server.
    These credentials are stored and managed within SQL Server, independent of Windows accounts.

3. Mixed Mode Authentication: 
    Mixed Mode Authentication, also known as SQL Server and Windows Authentication Mode, allows the use of both Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication.
    This mode provides flexibility, allowing connections from both Windows-authenticated users and users with SQL Server logins.

4. Azure Active Directory Authentication:
    In Microsoft Azure, SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance can use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication.
    Users connect using their Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials.
