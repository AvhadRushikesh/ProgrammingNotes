Question - What is ORM? What are the different types of ORM?


ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database model and the object-oriented programming model.
It eliminates the need for developers to write complex SQL queries and manual data conversion code by automatically translating database records into objects in the application code and vice versa.

There are different types of ORM
Table Module ORM:
    Each table in the database is represented by a class in the application code, 
    and instances of these classes correspond to rows in the table.
Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) ORM:
    Allows flexible representation of data by storing entities, attributes, and values in separate tables.
Single Table Inheritance (STI) ORM:
    Represents a hierarchy of classes in a single database table,
    using a discriminator column to differentiate between different types of entities.
Class Table Inheritance (CTI) ORM:
    Represents a hierarchy of classes using multiple tables, with one table for the common attributes and separate tables for each subclass.
Concrete Table Inheritance (CTI) ORM:
    Similar to CTI, but each table in the hierarchy represents a concrete class (no common table).
    Tables may share some columns.
Mapped Superclass Inheritance ORM:
    Represents a hierarchy of classes where a superclass is not persistent,
    but it defines common properties and behaviors shared by the subclasses.
