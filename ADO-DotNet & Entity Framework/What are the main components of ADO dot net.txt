Question - What are the main components of ADO.NET?


ADO.NET (Active Data Objects for .NET) is a set of classes in the .NET Framework for accessing and manipulating data from diverse sources,
such as relational databases, XML, and more. 

The main components of ADO.NET include:
1. Connection: 
    The Connection object establishes a connection to a data source, such as a database.
    It includes information like the data source's location, authentication credentials, and other settings.
    
    SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(“connectionString”);

2. Command:
    The Command object represents a SQL or other database command that is executed against a data source.
    It includes commands like SqlCommand for SQL Server, OleDbCommand for OLE DB data sources, etc.
    
    SqlCommand sqlCommand = new SqlCommand(“SELECT * FROM TableName”, sqlConnection);
 
3. DataReader: 
    The DataReader reads a forward-only stream of rows from a data source.
    It provides a way to efficiently read data from a data source, one record at a time.

    SqlDataReader sqlDataReader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();

4. DataAdapter:
    The DataAdapter serves as a bridge between a DataSet and a data source for retrieving and saving data.
    It includes SqlDataAdapter for SQL Server, OleDbDataAdapter for OLE DB data sources, etc.

    SqlDataAdapter sqlDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(sqlCommand);

5. DataSet:
    The DataSet is an in-memory cache of data retrieved from a data source.
    It can contain multiple DataTable objects, each representing a result set from a database query.

    DataSet dataset = new DataSet();

6. DataTable: 
    The DataTable is an in-memory representation of a database table.
    It contains a collection of DataRow objects, each representing a row in the table.

    DataTable dataTable = dataSet.Tables[0];
 
7. DataRow: 
    The DataRow represents a row of data in a DataTable. 
    It allows you to access and manipulate the data within a specific row.

    DataRow dataRow = dataTable.Rows[0];
 
8. DataView: 
    The DataView provides a way to create a customized view of a DataTable.
    It allows sorting, filtering, and searching within the DataTable.

    DataView dataView = new DataView(dataTable);

These components work together to retrieve, manipulate, and update data in a connected or disconnected manner,
providing flexibility and efficiency in data access for .NET applications.
The choice of components depends on factors such as the data source, application requirements, and performance considerations.
