Question - What are the different execute methods of ADO.NET?


ExecuteNonQuery: 
    Executes a SQL command that doesn't return data, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.
ExecuteScalar:
    Executes a SQL command that returns a single value (an aggregate value or the result of a SELECT statement with a single result).
ExecuteReader:
     Executes a SQL command that returns a data reader, allowing forward-only, read-only access to the result set.
ExecuteXmlReader:
    Executes a SQL command that returns an XML reader, specifically designed for reading XML data. 
BeginExecuteNonQuery:
    Asynchronously executes a SQL command that doesn't return data.
    It starts the command and returns control to the calling program, which can later retrieve the results.
