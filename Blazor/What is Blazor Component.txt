Question - What is Blazor Component?


A Blazor component is a self-contained, reusable unit that defines the UI and behavior for a specific part of a web application.
Components in Blazor are the fundamental building blocks of the user interface, allowing developers to create modular and maintainable code.
Each component encapsulates a piece of the user interface and can include both HTML markup and C# code.

Here are the key characteristics of a Blazor component:
Markup and Code:
    A Blazor component consists of both HTML markup and C# code, combined in a single file with the .razor extension.
    The markup defines the structure and layout of the component, while the C# code provides the logic and behavior.
Syntax:
    Components use a combination of HTML-like syntax and Razor syntax for embedding C# code within the markup.
    Razor syntax is denoted by @ followed by C# code, allowing seamless integration of C# logic into the markup.
Reusability:
    Components are designed for reusability.
    Developers can create components for specific UI elements, such as buttons, forms, or custom widgets,
    and reuse them across different pages or layouts.
Lifecycle Methods:
    Components have a lifecycle with various methods that can be overridden to perform actions at specific points in the component's life,
    such as initialization, rendering, and disposal.
    Examples of lifecycle methods include OnInitialized, OnParametersSet, OnAfterRender, and others.
Parameters:
    Components can accept parameters, which are values passed from a parent component or page.
    Parameters enable communication between components and make it possible to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Event Handling:
    Components can handle user interactions and events, such as button clicks or form submissions, using event handlers.
    Event handling in Blazor is similar to handling events in traditional web development.
Child Components:
    Components can contain other components as child components, forming a hierarchical structure.
    This enables the creation of complex user interfaces by composing smaller, reusable pieces.
Code-Behind Model:
    Components follow a code-behind model where the HTML markup and C# code are combined in a single file.
    The C# code contains the logic for the component, and it can include methods, properties, and other members.

Here is a simple example of a Blazor component:
    
    htmlCopy code
    <!-- MyComponent.razor -->
    <h3>@title</h3>

    <button @onclick="ButtonClick">Click me</button>

    @code {
        private string title = "Welcome to MyComponent";

        private void ButtonClick()
        {
            title = "Button Clicked!";
        }
    }

In this example, MyComponent is a Blazor component that displays a title and a button.
When the button is clicked, the ButtonClick method is called, updating the title.
This is just a basic illustration, and Blazor components can become more complex as they handle parameters, events,
and interact with other components within an application.
