Question - What is the difference between @onclick and @onclick:event in Blazor?

@onclick is a concise syntax for simple click event handling,
while @onclick:event provides more control when you need access to event arguments and additional event details.

In Blazor, both @onclick and @onclick:event are used for handling click events,
but they have different use cases.

@onclick:
    This is a shorthand syntax for handling the onclick event in Blazor components.
    It is typically used for simple scenarios where you want to provide a single line of code to be executed when the element is clicked.
    
    Example:
    htmlCopy code
    <button @onclick="HandleButtonClick">Click me</button>

    @code {
        private void HandleButtonClick()
        {
            // Code to be executed on button click
        }
    }

@onclick:event:
    This syntax is used when you need to handle the event and pass additional information to the event handler.
    It allows you to explicitly specify the event to handle and pass event arguments to the associated method.

    Example:
    htmlCopy code
    <button @onclick:event="HandleButtonClickWithArgs">Click me</button>

    @code {
        private void HandleButtonClickWithArgs(MouseEventArgs e)
        {
            // Code to be executed on button click with event arguments
            // You have access to event details like e.Button, e.ClientX, e.ClientY, etc.
        }
    }

    In this example,
    MouseEventArgs provides information about the mouse event, such as the button pressed, client coordinates, etc.
