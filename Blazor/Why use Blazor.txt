Question - Why use Blazor?


Blazor is a web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and 
.NET instead of JavaScript.

Here are some reasons why developers might choose to use Blazor:
C# and .NET Development: 
    Blazor allows developers to leverage their existing skills in C# and .NET for web development.
    This can be advantageous for teams already familiar with these technologies,
    as it enables code reuse and reduces the learning curve for building web applications.
Full-stack Development:
    With Blazor, developers can use C# for both client-side and server-side development.
    This enables full-stack development with a single language, improving code maintainability and reducing context switching
    between different languages.
Component-based Architecture:
    Blazor follows a component-based architecture, similar to other modern web frameworks like React or Angular.
    Components are self-contained units of code that encapsulate both the UI and the logic.
    This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.
Razor Syntax:
    Blazor uses Razor syntax, a syntax for embedding C# code into HTML files.
    This makes it easy for developers who are already familiar with Razor syntax from other ASP.NET technologies to transition to Blazor.
Integration with Visual Studio:
    Blazor integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio, Microsoft's popular integrated development environment (IDE).
    Developers can take advantage of features like IntelliSense, debugging, and other tools provided by Visual Studio.
Cross-platform Development:
    Blazor enables cross-platform development, allowing developers to target both web browsers and mobile devices using the same codebase.
    This is made possible through the use of Blazor WebAssembly for client-side development and Blazor Server for server-side development.
WebAssembly Support:
    Blazor WebAssembly allows developers to run C# code directly in the browser, thanks to WebAssembly.
    This provides near-native performance and allows developers to build rich, client-side web applications without relying on JavaScript.
Access to .NET Ecosystem:
    By using Blazor, developers can leverage the extensive .NET ecosystem, including libraries, tools, and third-party components available for 
    the .NET platform.
Security:
    Blazor applications benefit from the security features of the .NET runtime and can take advantage of existing authentication and
    authorization mechanisms.
