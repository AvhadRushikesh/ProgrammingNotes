Question - Explain two-way data binding in Blazor.


Two-way data binding in Blazor allows you to establish a synchronization between the values of a property in the component's
C# code (in the @code block) and the corresponding value in the component's Razor markup.
When the property value changes in either the C# code or the Razor markup, the change is automatically reflected in the other,
ensuring a two-way communication of data.

Blazor achieves two-way data binding through a combination of the @bind directive and the use of properties with a specific naming convention.

Here's how two-way data binding works in Blazor:
Declare a Property with the Appropriate Naming Convention:
    To enable two-way data binding, declare a property in the @code block with the same name as the property in the Razor markup,
    but with an additional @ symbol as a prefix.
    razorCopy code
    <!-- ExampleComponent.razor -->
    <input type="text" @bind="@inputValue" />

    @code {
        private string inputValue = "Initial Value";

        // Property with the same name as in the Razor markup, prefixed with @
        private string @bind-InputValue
        {
            get { return inputValue; }
            set { inputValue = value; }
        }
    }


Use the @bind Directive in the Razor Markup:
    In the Razor markup, use the @bind directive to bind the property to the corresponding HTML element.
    This establishes the two-way data binding.
    razorCopy code
    <!-- ExampleComponent.razor -->

    <input type="text" @bind="@inputValue" />
    The @bind directive tells Blazor to create a two-way binding between the property (inputValue in this case)
    and the value of the HTML element (input field in this case).

Update in Either Direction:
    Now, changes to the value of the inputValue property in the C# code will automatically update the value in the associated
    input field in the Razor markup, and vice versa.
    This two-way synchronization happens seamlessly.
    razorCopy code
    <!-- ExampleComponent.razor -->

    <input type="text" @bind="@inputValue" />

    <p>Value in C# code: @inputValue</p>
    Any changes made to the input field in the browser will be reflected in the inputValue property in the C# code,
    and any changes made to inputValue in the C# code will be reflected in the input field.

Two-way data binding simplifies the management of data flow between the UI and the underlying C# code,
making it more convenient to handle user input and maintain a synchronized state between different parts of the component.
