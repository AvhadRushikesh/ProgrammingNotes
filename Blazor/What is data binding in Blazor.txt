Question - What is data binding in Blazor?


Data binding in Blazor refers to the synchronization of data between the application's user interface (UI) and the underlying data model.
Blazor provides a rich set of features for data binding, allowing you to connect UI elements to data sources,
respond to user input, and update the UI automatically as the data changes.

There are two main types of data binding in Blazor:
One-Way Data Binding:
    In one-way data binding, data flows in one direction: from the data source to the UI.
    Changes in the data source automatically update the UI elements bound to that data.
    
    Example:
    Displaying a property value in the UI.
    csharpCopy code
    <p>The current count is: @currentCount</p>
    
    @code {
        private int currentCount = 0;
        private void IncrementCount()
        {
            currentCount++;
        }
    }
    In this example, the currentCount variable is bound to the <p> element.
    Any changes to currentCount are automatically reflected in the displayed text.

Two-Way Data Binding:
    Two-way data binding allows changes in the UI to propagate back to the data source.
    This is useful for forms and interactive UI elements where user input should update the underlying data.
    
    Example:
    Binding an input field to a property.
    csharpCopy code
    <input type="text" @bind="userName" />
    <p>Hello, @userName!</p>
    
    @code {
        private string userName = "Guest";
    }
    
    In this example, the userName variable is bound to the input field using @bind.
    Any changes made in the input field by the user will update the userName variable, and the greeting message will be updated accordingly.

Blazor supports various mechanisms for data binding, including:
    @bind Directive:
        Used for two-way data binding, as demonstrated in the second example above.
    @value and @oninput Directives:
        Used for two-way data binding in input elements.
    @on[event] Directives:
        Used to handle UI events and update the data accordingly.
    @if, @for, and @foreach Directives:
        Used for conditional rendering and iteration over data collections.
    Component Parameters:
        Passing data between parent and child components using parameters.

Event Binding:
    Event binding is in Blazor is supported by using function name along with @ i.e. @ButtonClicked (here ButtonClicked is function name)
