Question - How does Blazor WebAssembly enable running C-Sharp code in the browser?


Blazor WebAssembly enables running C# code in the browser by leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm),
a binary instruction format designed to be executed at near-native speed in web browsers.
WebAssembly allows developers to run code written in languages other than JavaScript in the browser,
providing a more diverse set of languages for web development.

Here's an overview of how Blazor WebAssembly achieves running C# code in the browser:
Compilation to WebAssembly:
    The C# code of a Blazor WebAssembly application is compiled to WebAssembly bytecode during the build process.
    This compilation is performed by the .NET Core runtime and toolchain.
Intermediate Language (IL) and .NET Runtime:
    The C# code is initially compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) by the .NET compiler.
    The IL is then processed by the .NET runtime, which includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
Mono Runtime for WebAssembly:
    For Blazor WebAssembly, the Mono runtime (an open-source implementation of the .NET runtime) is used specifically
    for targeting WebAssembly.
    Mono has been extended to support the WebAssembly execution environment.
WebAssembly Binary:
    The Mono runtime, along with the application's IL, is compiled into a WebAssembly binary (.wasm file).
    This binary contains the instructions that can be executed by the WebAssembly engine in the browser.
JavaScript Interoperability:
    Blazor WebAssembly uses JavaScript interoperability to bridge the gap between the .NET runtime running in WebAssembly 
    and the JavaScript environment of the browser.
    This allows communication between C# and JavaScript code.
Execution in the Browser:
    The WebAssembly binary is loaded into the browser along with the necessary JavaScript runtime.
    When the application is accessed in a web browser, the browser's JavaScript engine executes the WebAssembly binary.
Rendering in the Browser:
    Blazor WebAssembly utilizes the browser's rendering capabilities to display the user interface.
    The rendering is achieved through the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript interop.
Full .NET Runtime Experience:
    Once the application is loaded and running in the browser, users experience a full .NET runtime environment.
    The C# code runs on the client side, and the application can make use of .NET libraries and features,
    just as it would in a server-side Blazor application.

By utilizing WebAssembly and the Mono runtime, Blazor WebAssembly extends the reach of .NET applications to the client-side,
allowing developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET technologies.
This approach provides a unified development experience for both server-side and client-side code within the .NET ecosystem.
