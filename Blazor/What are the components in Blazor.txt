Question - What are the components in Blazor?


In Blazor, components are self-contained and reusable building blocks for building web applications.
Components encapsulate both the UI (User Interface) and the logic needed to render and respond to user interactions.
The component-based architecture of Blazor is similar to other modern web frameworks like React and Angular.

Here are the key types of components in Blazor:
Razor Components:
    Blazor Server-Side Components:
        These components run on the server, and their UI is rendered on the server side.
        Updates to the UI are then sent to the client over a SignalR connection, ensuring a responsive user experience.
    Blazor WebAssembly Components:
        These components run directly in the browser using WebAssembly.
        The entire component and its logic are downloaded to the client,
        allowing for client-side rendering and interactivity without the need for frequent server communication.
Pages:
    Blazor supports the creation of pages, similar to traditional ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.
    Pages in Blazor typically represent a discrete unit of user interface and functionality.
Layouts:
    Layouts define the structure of the pages and provide a consistent look and feel across multiple pages.
    They often contain common elements such as headers, footers, and navigation menus.
    Layouts can be used to enforce a consistent UI design throughout the application.
Components:
    Components are the fundamental building blocks in Blazor.
    They can be standalone or nested within other components. 
    Components can have parameters, allowing them to receive data from parent components.
    They can also emit events to communicate with parent components.
Code-Behind Files:
    Components in Blazor can have associated code-behind files written in C#.
    These files contain the logic and event-handling code for the corresponding Razor component.
    The separation of markup and code promotes clean and maintainable code.
Component Parameters:
    Parameters are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
    Parameters can be simple values, objects, or even callback functions.
    They facilitate communication between components in a hierarchical structure.
Event Handling:
    Components can handle user interactions, such as button clicks or form submissions,
    by defining event handlers in the associated code-behind file.
    Events can also be raised and captured by parent and child components to enable communication.
Routing:
    Blazor applications often use a routing system to navigate between pages and components.
    The routing system maps URLs to components or pages, allowing for a structured and navigable application.
Dependency Injection:
    Blazor supports dependency injection, allowing components to request and use services.
    This is particularly useful for accessing data, managing state, or interacting with external services within a component.
JS Interop:
    Blazor components can interoperate with JavaScript code through a feature known as JS Interop.
    This enables developers to use existing JavaScript libraries or call custom JavaScript functions from within their C# code.
