Question - Explain the role of the @page directive in Blazor routing?


This directive is used to define the route template for a Blazor component or page.
In Blazor, the @page directive plays a crucial role in associating a component or page with a specific route.
The route template specifies the URL at which the component should be accessible.


Here's how the @page directive works in the context of Blazor routing:
Defining Routes:
    The @page directive is placed at the top of a Blazor component or page file.
    It specifies the route template for that component, indicating the URL path that should activate and display the component.

    csharpCopy code
    @page "/counter"
    In this example, the Counter component is associated with the "/counter" route.
    When a user navigates to the "/counter" URL, the Counter component will be rendered.

Parameterized Routes:
    The @page directive also supports parameterized routes, allowing you to define routes with dynamic parameters.

    csharpCopy code
    @page "/user/{id}"
    In this example, the User component is associated with the "/user/{id}" route.
    The {id} part indicates a parameter, and the actual value will be provided in the URL.

Implicit Route Handling:
    If a component does not have a @page directive, it won't be directly accessible via a URL.
    Instead, it must be included within another component or page that has a @page directive.
    
    Components without a @page directive are typically used as child components within a layout or another component.
    They are not directly navigable through the URL, but they can receive parameters or data from their parent components.

Route Parameters and Component Parameters:
    When using parameterized routes, the parameters defined in the route template are often matched to corresponding parameters in the component.

    csharpCopy code
    @page "/user/{id}"

    <h3>User Details</h3>
    <p>User ID: @id</p>

    @code {
        [Parameter]
        public string id { get; set; }
    }

    In this example, the id parameter in the User component is bound to the value provided in the URL.
