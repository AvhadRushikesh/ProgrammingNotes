Question - What is the difference between Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly?


Blazor is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript.
There are two hosting models in Blazor: Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.

Here are the key differences between them:
Blazor Server:
    Execution Model:
        The server model runs on the server, and UI interactions are handled on the server side.
        The application's UI is rendered on the server, and only the UI events and updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection.
        This means that the client has a lightweight runtime and relies on the server for processing logic.
    Performance:
        Offers good performance, but the responsiveness of the application is dependent on the network latency and the connection to the server.
        UI updates involve communication between the client and the server.
    Network Requirements:
        Requires a constant connection to the server for UI updates and event handling.
        The application remains responsive, but network latency can impact the user experience.
    Hosting:
        Hosted on a server that supports ASP.NET Core, such as IIS or Azure App Service.
    Scalability:
        Scales well for applications with a moderate number of users.
        The server-side processing can become a bottleneck when dealing with a large number of concurrent users.

Blazor WebAssembly:
    Execution Model:
        The WebAssembly (Wasm) model allows the application to run directly in the browser using WebAssembly.
        The entire application, including the UI rendering and logic, is executed on the client-side within the browser.
        This eliminates the need for a constant connection to the server after the initial download.
    Performance:
        Can provide a faster user experience as the application runs directly in the browser.
        However, the initial load time might be longer due to the need to download the necessary .NET runtime and application assemblies to
        the client.
    Network Requirements:
        After the initial download, the application can run offline as it is self-contained within the browser.
        However, initial load times and subsequent updates may depend on the network speed.
    Hosting:
        Can be hosted on static file servers (like GitHub Pages or Azure Storage) since it doesn't require server-side processing
        after the initial download.
        It can also be hosted on any server that can serve static files.
    Scalability:
        Scales more easily as the client handles its own processing.
        Server resources are mainly required for initial downloads, and subsequent user interactions don't put as much load on the server.
