Question - Explain the lifecycle methods of a Blazor component?


Blazor components have a lifecycle with various methods that are called at different stages during the component's existence.
These lifecycle methods provide developers with hooks to execute code at specific moments, allowing them to perform tasks like initialization,
clean-up, and responding to changes.

Here is an overview of the main lifecycle methods of a Blazor component:

OnInitialized:
    Description:
        This method is called when the component has been initialized, but it has not yet been rendered.
    Use Cases:
        Initialization logic that needs to be performed before the component is rendered.
    
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        // Initialization logic
    }

OnInitializedAsync:
    Description:
        Similar to OnInitialized, but it supports asynchronous operations.
    Use Cases:
        Asynchronous initialization tasks.

OnParametersSet:
    Description:
        This method is called whenever parameter values for the component are set or changed.
    Use Cases:
        Responding to changes in component parameters.

OnParametersSetAsync:
    Description:
        Similar to OnParametersSet, but supports asynchronous operations.
    Use Cases:
        Asynchronous logic in response to changes in parameters.
    
OnAfterRender:
    Description:
        This method is called after the component has been rendered in the browser.
    Use Cases:
        Performing actions after the component has been rendered, such as interacting with the DOM.
    
OnAfterRenderAsync:
    Description:
        Similar to OnAfterRender, but supports asynchronous operations.
    Use Cases:
        Asynchronous logic after the component has been rendered.

ShouldRender:
    Description:
        This method is used to determine whether the component should render.
        It returns a boolean indicating whether rendering should occur.
    Use Cases:
        Controlling the rendering process based on certain conditions.

Dispose:
    Description:
        This method is called when the component is being disposed of, allowing for cleanup operations.
    Use Cases:
        Disposing of resources, canceling asynchronous tasks, or releasing references.

These lifecycle methods give developers fine-grained control over the behavior of Blazor components throughout their lifecycle.
By overriding these methods, developers can execute custom logic at specific moments during the component's existence,
enabling a wide range of use cases, from initialization to cleanup and beyond.
