Question - What is the purpose of the @code block in a Blazor component?


The @code block in a Blazor component is used to include C# code that is associated with the component.
This block is where you can define fields, properties, methods, and other C# code that is specific to the behavior and logic of the component.

Here are some key aspects of the @code block:
Fields and Properties:
    You can declare fields and properties within the @code block.
    These fields and properties are accessible within the component,
    allowing you to store and manage data that is specific to the component's instance.
    razorCopy code
    @code {
        private string message = "Hello from the component!";
    }

Component Parameters:
    If your component accepts parameters, you can define them within the @code block.
    Parameters are used to pass data into the component from its parent.
    razorCopy code
    @code {
        [Parameter]
        public string Title { get; set; }
    }

Methods:
    You can define methods within the @code block to encapsulate the component's logic.
    These methods can be called from the component's markup or from other methods within the @code block.
    razorCopy code
    @code {
        private void DisplayMessage()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Displaying the message");
        }
    }

Lifecycle Methods:
    Blazor components have lifecycle methods that are automatically called at different stages of the component's lifecycle.
    These methods can be defined in the @code block to perform actions during specific lifecycle events.
    razorCopy code
    @code {
        protected override void OnInitialized()
        {
            // Initialization logic
        }

        protected override void OnParametersSet()
        {
            // Parameter setting logic
        }

        // Other lifecycle methods...
    }

Code-Behind:
    The @code block can be complemented with a code-behind file (.cs file) to separate the markup and C# code.
    This is useful for maintaining clean and organized code, especially for larger components.
    csharpCopy code
    // ExampleComponent.razor.cs

    public partial class ExampleComponent
    {
        // Code-behind logic can be placed here
    }

the @code block is a crucial part of a Blazor component where you define the C# code associated with the component's behavior,
logic, and data management.
It allows you to create dynamic and interactive components by incorporating C# functionality directly into the Razor markup.
