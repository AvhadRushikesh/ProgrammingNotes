Question - How does routing work in a Blazor WebAssembly application?


Routing in a Blazor WebAssembly application is responsible for navigating between different pages or components within the application.
Blazor uses the client-side routing system to achieve this, allowing you to define routes, associate them with components,
and navigate between them using URLs.


Here's an overview of how routing works in a Blazor WebAssembly application:
    Configure Routes:
        Routing is typically configured in the Startup.cs file.
        In the ConfigureServices method, you add routing services:
        
        csharpCopy code
        services.AddRouting();
        
        In the Configure method, you configure the routes:
        csharpCopy code
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
            endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
        });

        The MapBlazorHub method adds the Blazor hub endpoint, and MapFallbackToPage sets up a fallback route that points to the _Host.cshtml page.
        This page acts as the entry point for your Blazor WebAssembly app and handles the client-side routing.

    Define Components and Pages:
        Components and pages are associated with specific routes.
        You can define a component or page and specify its route using the @page directive:

        csharpCopy code
        @page "/counter"
        In this example, the Counter component is associated with the "/counter" route.

    Navigate Between Routes:
        To navigate between routes, you can use the NavigationManager service provided by Blazor.
        It provides methods like NavigateTo:

        csharpCopy code
        @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

        <button @onclick="GoToCounter">Go to Counter</button>

        @code {
            private void GoToCounter()
            {
                NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/counter");
            }
        }
        
        In this example, clicking the button triggers the GoToCounter method, which uses NavigateTo to navigate to the "/counter" route.

    Parameterized Routes:
        You can define parameterized routes to pass parameters to components/pages.
        For example:
        
        csharpCopy code
        @page "/user/{id}"

        <h3>User Details</h3>
        <p>User ID: @id</p>

        @code {
            [Parameter]
            public string id { get; set; }
        }

        In this example, the route "/user/{id}" expects a parameter, and the User component receives it as a parameter.

    Navigation from Links:
        You can also use anchor tags (<a>) with the href attribute to create links for navigation:
        htmlCopy code
        <a href="/counter">Counter</a>
        Clicking on the link triggers navigation to the "/counter" route.

    Routing and Layouts:
        You can use layouts to define a common structure for your pages.
        Layouts are shared components that include common elements such as headers, footers, etc.

        csharpCopy code
        @inherits LayoutComponentBase

        <div>
            <header>
                <!-- Header content -->
            </header>

            <div class="content">
                @Body
            </div>

            <footer>
                <!-- Footer content -->
            </footer>
        </div>

    Pages and components can specify a layout using the @layout directive:
        csharpCopy code
        @layout MainLayout
        
        <h3>Counter</h3>
        <!-- Counter component content -->
        In this example, the Counter component uses the MainLayout as its layout.

This is a basic overview of how routing works in a Blazor WebAssembly application.
By configuring routes, associating components/pages with routes, and using the NavigationManager, 
you can create a navigation structure for your application.
