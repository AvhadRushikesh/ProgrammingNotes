Question - What is the purpose of the <ErrorBoundary> component in Blazor?


An error boundary in Blazor is a custom component that implements the IErrorBoundary interface.
The purpose of an error boundary is to handle exceptions that occur within the component itself or its descendant components.
When an error occurs within the subtree of an error boundary, the OnErrorAsync method of the error boundary is invoked,
allowing you to handle the error gracefully.

Here's an example of how you might implement an error boundary component in Blazor:
    csharpCopy code
    @implements IErrorBoundary

    @if (hasError)
    {
        <p>An error occurred within the component.</p>
    }
    else
    {
        @ChildContent
    }

    @code {
        private bool hasError = false;

        [Parameter]
        public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }

        // IErrorBoundary implementation
        public Task OnErrorAsync(Exception exception)
        {
            // Handle the error
            hasError = true;
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }
    
    In this example, the error boundary component (ErrorBoundary.razor) implements the IErrorBoundary interface and provides an
    OnErrorAsync method to handle errors.
    The ChildContent parameter allows you to include any content within the error boundary.
    If an error occurs within the ChildContent or its descendants, the error is caught by the error boundary,
    and the OnErrorAsync method is called to handle the error.

Error boundaries are useful for creating a more robust and fault-tolerant application by isolating errors and providing 
a controlled way to handle them within specific components.
