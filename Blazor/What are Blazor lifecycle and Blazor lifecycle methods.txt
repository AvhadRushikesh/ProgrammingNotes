Question - What are Blazor lifecycle and Blaozr lifecycle methods?


Blazor components have a lifecycle that defines the various stages a component goes through from its creation to its disposal.
During these stages, Blazor provides lifecycle methods that developers can override to execute custom code.
These lifecycle methods allow developers to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle.

Here are the main stages of the Blazor component lifecycle along with the corresponding methods:
Initialization:
    OnInitialized:
        This method is called when the component is first initialized.
        It is often used to perform one-time setup logic.
    OnInitializedAsync:
        This asynchronous method is similar to OnInitialized but allows for asynchronous initialization logic.
Parameter Setting:
    OnParametersSet:
        This method is called whenever parameters passed to the component are set or changed.
        It is useful for reacting to parameter changes.
    OnParametersSetAsync:
        Similar to OnParametersSet but asynchronous.
Rendering:
    Render:
        This method is responsible for rendering the component's UI.
        It is called whenever a component needs to be rendered.
    ShouldRender:
        This method is used to optimize rendering.
        It returns a boolean indicating whether the component should be re-rendered.
        If it returns false, the rendering process is skipped.
Updating:
    OnAfterRender:
        This method is called after the component has been rendered.
        It is often used for interacting with the rendered elements, such as setting up JavaScript interop.
    OnAfterRenderAsync:
        Similar to OnAfterRender but asynchronous.
    OnAfterRender(bool firstRender):
        This method is called after the component has been rendered, and it includes a boolean parameter indicating whether this is the first render.
Disposal:
    Dispose:
        This method is called when a component is about to be disposed of.
        It is used for cleaning up resources, such as unsubscribing from events or releasing unmanaged resources.
    Dispose(bool disposing):
        This overloaded Dispose method is called with a boolean parameter indicating whether the component is being disposed
        due to a call to IDisposable.Dispose.

These lifecycle methods provide hooks into the various stages of a component's life, allowing developers to execute custom logic when needed.
For example, you might use OnInitializedAsync to fetch data from a server when the component is first created,
or you might use OnAfterRender to perform actions after the component has been rendered.
