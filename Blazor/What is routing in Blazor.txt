Question - What is routing in Blazor?


In Blazor, routing refers to the process of navigating between different pages or components in a web application.
It allows you to create a navigational structure within your application, defining how URLs map to specific components or pages.
Blazor supports client-side routing (Blazor WebAssembly) and server-side routing (Blazor Server).
Routing is an essential aspect of creating a structured and navigable user interface in a Blazor application.
It allows you to define the relationships between different components or pages and enables users to move between them seamlessly.


Here's an overview of both:
Client-Side Routing (Blazor WebAssembly):
    In Blazor WebAssembly, the routing is handled on the client side,
    meaning that navigation and page rendering occur directly in the user's web browser.
    Routing is configured using the @page directive in Razor components.
    The @page directive specifies the route for the component.
    
    @page "/example"

    You can also use route parameters to capture values from the URL.
    @page "/user/{userId}"

    The NavigationManager service is commonly used to navigate between pages programmatically.
    @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager
    <button @onclick="NavigateToExample">Go to Example Page</button>
    @code {
        private void NavigateToExample()
        {
            NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/example");
        }
    }

Server-Side Routing (Blazor Server):
    In Blazor Server, the routing is handled on the server, and the user interacts with the application through a SignalR connection.
    The @page directive is still used to define routes for components.

    @page "/example"
    
    Navigation is typically done using standard HTML <a> elements or the NavigationManager service.
    <a href="/example">Go to Example Page</a>
    @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager
    <button @onclick="NavigateToExample">Go to Example Page</button>

    @code {
        private void NavigateToExample()
        {
            NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/example");
        }
    }

    Blazor Server also supports route parameters and query parameters.
