Question - What is Blazor?


Blazor is a free, open-source, cross-platform Web framework that allows developers to build modern, scalable, 
and cross-platform Web applications using C# and .NET.
Blazor developed by Microsoft and the open-source community is initially designed to keep in 
mind C# and .NET developers who want to build web client applications using C# language. 
Blazor is modern, fast, and rapidly evolving. 
Most web client applications are written using JavaScript where code mostly runs in the browser.
Blazor framework allows developers to create rich interactive UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. 
Blazor supports both client-side and server-side coding.
Both server-side and client-side app logic is written in .NET. 
Even though the code is written in .NET and C#, 
Blazor renders the UI as HTML and CSS for wide browser support, including mobile browsers. 

Here is a simple example of Blazor code that shows how HTML and C# are in the same file and how a function can be called from HTML code. 
    <h1>Counter</h1>
    <p>Current Count: @currentCount</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="@IncrementCount">Click me</button

    @code {
        private int currentCount = 0;
        private void IncrementCount()
        {
            currentCount++;
        }
    }
