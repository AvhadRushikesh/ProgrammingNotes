Question - How to deploy the Blazor app in Azure?


To publish the Blazor app on Azure, Right-click on the Server project of your solution and click publish. 
It will open the “Pick a publish target” window.
Select “App Service” from the left menu.
Select the “Create New” radio button and click on “Create profile”. 
The next window will ask you to log in to your Azure account if you are not logged in.
Once the login is successful, a “Create App Service” window will open.
The fields of this window are prepopulated as per the configuration of your Azure account.
However, you can change these values as per your requirement.




Steps to Deploy a Blazor WebAssembly App to Azure App Service:
Prepare Your Blazor WebAssembly App:
    Ensure your Blazor WebAssembly app is ready for deployment.
    Build the app to generate the necessary output files.
Create an Azure App Service:
    Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
    Click on "Create a resource," then search for "Web App."
    Fill in the required details, such as App Name, Subscription, Resource Group, and choose an appropriate OS (Windows or Linux).
    Configure the remaining settings and click "Review + create."
Configure Deployment Options:
    In the Azure portal, navigate to your App Service.
    In the left menu, select "Deployment Center."
    Choose a source repository for your app (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos, Bitbucket).
    Follow the prompts to configure the connection to your repository and choose the branch you want to deploy.
Configure Build Settings:
    Based on your repository, select the appropriate build provider (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines).
    Configure the build settings to build your Blazor WebAssembly app.
    This typically involves specifying the build and publish steps.
Deploy Your App:
    Trigger the deployment either manually or by setting up continuous integration.
    The deployment process will build your app and deploy it to the specified Azure App Service.
Configure Environment Variables (Optional):
    If your app relies on environment variables, configure them in the Azure portal.
    Navigate to your App Service, go to "Configuration," and add the necessary settings.
Verify Deployment:
    Once the deployment is complete, navigate to the URL of your Azure App Service to verify that your Blazor app is running successfully.
Additional Considerations:
    Custom Domain:
        If you have a custom domain, configure it in the Azure portal under "Custom domains" for your App Service.
    SSL Configuration:
        Consider enabling SSL for your App Service.
        You can use Azure's built-in certificate or bring your own SSL certificate.
    Scaling:
        Adjust the scaling settings based on your app's needs.
