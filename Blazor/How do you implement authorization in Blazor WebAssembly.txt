Question - How do you implement authorization in Blazor WebAssembly?


Implementing authorization in Blazor WebAssembly involves checking and controlling access to various parts of your application based
on the user's roles, claims, or other criteria.

Here are the general steps to implement authorization in a Blazor WebAssembly application:
Define Roles and Claims:
    Determine the roles and claims that you want to use for authorization.
    Roles represent different levels of access, while claims are additional pieces of information associated with a user.
Configure Authentication and Authorization in Startup:
    Open the Startup.cs file in your server project.
    Configure authentication services and set up authorization policies.
    You can use the AddAuthorization method to configure policies based on roles or claims.
    
    csharpCopy code
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("RequireAdmin", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
        options.AddPolicy("RequireUser", policy => policy.RequireRole("User"));
    });

Apply Authorization Policies to Components:
    In your Blazor components, you can use the AuthorizeView component or the Authorize attribute to apply authorization policies.
    
    csharpCopy code
    @page "/admin"

    <AuthorizeView Policy="RequireAdmin">
        <Authorized>
            <p>Welcome, Admin!</p>
        </Authorized>
        <NotAuthorized>
            <p>Access Denied. You must be an Admin to view this page.</p>
        </NotAuthorized>
    </AuthorizeView>

    Alternatively, you can use the Authorize attribute directly on a component or a route:

    csharpCopy code
    @attribute [Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdmin")]
    @page "/admin"

    <p>Welcome, Admin!</p>

Check Authorization Programmatically:
    You can also check authorization programmatically in your code-behind or code blocks using the CascadingAuthenticationState component.

    csharpCopy code
    @inject AuthenticationStateProvider AuthenticationStateProvider
    @inject IAuthorizationService AuthorizationService

    @code {
        private bool isAuthorized;

        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            var authenticationState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
            isAuthorized = (await AuthorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(authenticationState.User, "RequireAdmin")).Succeeded;
        }

Handle Authorization Events:
    You can handle authorization events, such as when a user is denied access.
    For example, you can use the OnForbidden event handler in the AuthorizeView component.
    
    csharpCopy code
    <AuthorizeView Policy="RequireAdmin" OnForbidden="HandleForbidden">
        <Authorized>
            <!-- Content for authorized users -->
        </Authorized>
    </AuthorizeView>

    @code {
        private void HandleForbidden()
        {
            // Handle forbidden access
            // Redirect, show a message, etc.
        }
    }

Test Authorization:
    Run your application and test the authorization by logging in with different user roles or claims.
    Ensure that users can access or are denied access to specific parts of the application based on the defined authorization policies.

By following these steps, you can implement authorization in a Blazor WebAssembly application, 
controlling access to different areas based on roles, claims, or other criteria.
