Question - What is Blazor WebAssembly?


Blazor WebAssembly is a client-side web framework developed by Microsoft as part of the Blazor project.
It allows developers to build interactive and single-page applications (SPAs) using C# and .NET languages to run directly in the browser.
Blazor WebAssembly leverages WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that runs natively in web browsers,
enabling near-native performance for client-side web applications.

Key features and aspects of Blazor WebAssembly include:
Client-Side Execution:
    Unlike Blazor Server, which runs components on the server and sends UI updates to the client over a SignalR connection,
    Blazor WebAssembly runs the entire application directly in the browser.
    This means that the client's device executes the C# code, and there is less dependency on constant server communication for UI updates.
WebAssembly Integration:
    WebAssembly (often abbreviated as wasm) is a low-level binary instruction format that enables high-performance execution in web browsers.
    Blazor WebAssembly takes advantage of WebAssembly to execute .NET-based code in the browser alongside JavaScript.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:
    Blazor WebAssembly applications are cross-platform and can run on various web browsers that support WebAssembly, including Chrome,
    Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
    This allows developers to target a wide range of devices and operating systems.
.NET Standard Compatibility:
    Blazor WebAssembly applications can share code and libraries with other .NET applications, thanks to the use of .NET Standard.
    This compatibility allows developers to reuse existing .NET code and libraries, promoting code sharing and reducing development effort.
Full .NET Ecosystem Access:
    Developers have access to the full range of libraries, frameworks, and tools available in the .NET ecosystem.
    This includes the ability to use popular NuGet packages and integrate with services and technologies commonly used in the 
    .NET development community.
Razor Components:
    Blazor WebAssembly uses Razor Components, a component-based architecture similar to Blazor Server.
    Developers can create reusable and modular components that encapsulate both UI and logic.
Offline Support:
    Blazor WebAssembly applications can be designed as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), offering features like offline support,
    service workers, and the ability to be installed on users' devices.
Debugging Support:
    Developers can use their preferred debugging tools, including browser developer tools and Visual Studio,
    to debug and diagnose issues in Blazor WebAssembly applications.
