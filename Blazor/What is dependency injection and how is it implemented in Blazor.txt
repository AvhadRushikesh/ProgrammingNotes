Question - What is dependency injection and how it is implemented in Blazor?


Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and a technique widely used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC). 
In simple terms, it is a way to provide the necessary dependencies (objects or services) to a component rather than letting the
component create or manage those dependencies itself.

This helps in making the code modular, testable, and maintainable.
In the context of Blazor, which is a web framework developed by Microsoft, dependency injection is used to manage the dependencies of components.
Blazor allows you to use dependency injection to inject services into your components,
making it easy to access shared functionality or data across different parts of your application.

Here's a basic example of how dependency injection works in Blazor:
Service Definition:
    You start by defining a service interface and its implementation.
    This could be a class providing some functionality that you want to use across multiple components.

    csharpCopy code
    public interface IMyService
    {
        void DoSomething();
    }

    public class MyService : IMyService
    {
        public void DoSomething()
        {
            // Implementation code
        }
    }

Service Registration:
    Next, you register your service in the Startup class.
    This tells the Blazor application how to create and manage instances of your service.

    csharpCopy code
    services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
    This registration is typically done in the ConfigureServices method within the Startup class.

Service Injection:
    Now, you can inject your service into Blazor components.
    This is typically done through the component's constructor.

    csharpCopy code
    @inject IMyService MyService

    <h3>My Component</h3>

    @code {
        protected override void OnInitialized()
        {
            MyService.DoSomething();
        }
    }

    In this example, the IMyService is injected into the component, and you can use its methods or properties within the component.

Using Services:
    Finally, you can use the injected service within your component's logic.

    csharpCopy code
    @page "/mycomponent"

    <h3>My Component</h3>

    @code {
        protected override void OnInitialized()
        {
            MyService.DoSomething();
        }
    }
    Now, whenever the component is initialized, it can use the functionality provided by the injected service.

This pattern makes it easy to replace or modify services without changing the components that use them.
It also facilitates testing, as you can easily substitute real services with mock implementations for testing purposes.
