Question - What are templated components in Blazor?


Blazor uses the Razor template engine that generates HTML and serves to the web browsers.
We can mix HTML and C# syntax in the Razor templates and Razor engine then compiles the Razor templates to generate the HTML.
Blazor (version 0.6.0) supports the templated component.
It is a component that accepts one or more UI templates as parameters and these parameters can be used for component rendering.
It allows us to write high-level reusable components.
Using templated components, we can write a generic and more reusable component.
We can create the templated component by using one or more component parameters of type RenderFragment or RenderFragment<T>.
The RenderFragment is a part of UI which is rendered by the component.
It may have parameters that are used during the rendering of the component or while the RenderFragment is invoked.
Templated components are especially useful when you want to create flexible and reusable components that can adapt to different use cases.
They provide a powerful mechanism for component consumers to inject their own content or behavior into predefined areas of a component.


In Blazor,
templated components are a way to create reusable components with flexible and customizable rendering.
Templated components allow you to define a component that includes a template for rendering content,
and then users of the component can customize the appearance or behavior of the component by providing their own markup
or code within the defined template.

Here's a basic overview of how templated components work in Blazor:
Creating a Templated Component:
    You define a component with a template by using the RenderFragment type in the component's parameters or properties.
    The RenderFragment type allows users to pass in a block of content or code that will be rendered within the component.
    
    csharpCopy code
    // Example of a templated component
    <MyTemplatedComponent>
        <Template>
            <!-- Custom content or code provided by the user -->
            <p>Hello from the template!</p>
        </Template>
    </MyTemplatedComponent>
    
Using the Template in the Component:
    Within the component, you use the provided RenderFragment to render the template.
    The RenderFragment can be rendered using the @ChildContent directive.
    
    csharpCopy code
    @inherits ComponentBase

    <div>
        <h3>My Templated Component</h3>
        @ChildContent
    </div>

    @code {
        [Parameter]
        public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }
    }

Customizing the Template:
    Users of the component can provide their own content or code to be rendered within the template.
    This allows for a high degree of customization without modifying the underlying component.
    
    csharpCopy code
    <MyTemplatedComponent>
        <Template>
            <!-- Custom content or code provided by the user -->
            <p>Hello, customized template!</p>
            <button>Click me!</button>
        </Template>
    </MyTemplatedComponent>
