Question - What is the Role of Async and Await?


Role of async and await:
1.	Asynchronous Programming:
•	Asynchronous programming allows the execution of code to continue while waiting for an asynchronous operation 
    (such as I/O or a network request) to complete.
2.	Non-Blocking Execution:
•	When the await keyword is encountered in an asynchronous method, it yields control back to the calling method,
    allowing the calling method to execute other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
    This results in non-blocking execution.
3.	Avoiding Callback Hell:
•	Prior to the introduction of async and await, asynchronous code often involved nesting callbacks (callback hell).
    async and await make asynchronous code more readable and maintainable by allowing a linear flow of code.
