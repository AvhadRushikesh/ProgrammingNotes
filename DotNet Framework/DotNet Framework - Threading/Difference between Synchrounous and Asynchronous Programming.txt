Question - What is the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming?


Synchronous Programming:
1.	Blocking Nature:
•	Definition: In synchronous programming, operations are performed sequentially, one after the other.
•	Blocking: When an operation is initiated, the program is typically blocked, and the control flow waits for the operation to complete before moving on to the next one.
•	Advantages: The code tends to have a straightforward and predictable flow, making it easier to understand and debug.
•	Disadvantages: It may lead to inefficiencies, especially in scenarios where waiting for an operation to complete is not the most productive use of time.

Asynchronous Programming:
1.	Non-Blocking Nature:
•	Definition: In asynchronous programming, operations are initiated, but the program does not wait for them to complete. Instead, it continues with other tasks.
•	Non-Blocking: The control flow is not halted, allowing the program to perform other operations while waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish.
