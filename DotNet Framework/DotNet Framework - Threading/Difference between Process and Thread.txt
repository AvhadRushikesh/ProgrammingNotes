Question - What is the difference between Process and Thread?

Process: 
A process is an independent program that runs in its own memory space and has its own resources.
It is an independent unit of execution and is isolated from other processes.

Thread:
A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process.
Threads share the same resources, including memory space, with other threads in the same process.
