Question - Can we force Garbage Collector to run?


Yes, you can request the garbage collector to run explicitly using the GC.Collect method.
However, it's important to note that manually forcing garbage collection is generally not recommended in most scenarios.
The garbage collector in .NET is designed to operate automatically and efficiently manage memory without manual intervention.
Explicitly triggering garbage collection can lead to suboptimal performance and should be used judiciously.
The GC.Collect method is part of the System.GC class,
which provides a set of static methods for interacting with the garbage collector. 
The Collect method is used to request garbage collection for all generations.
