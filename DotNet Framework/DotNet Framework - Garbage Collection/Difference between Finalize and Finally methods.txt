Question - What is Difference between "Finalize" and "Finally" Methods?


Finalize Method:
The Finalize method is a special method in C# that serves as a destructor for a class.
It is automatically called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed,
providing an opportunity for the object to perform cleanup operations.

Finally Block:
The finally block is part of a try-catch-finally statement structure in C#.
The code within the finally block is executed whether an exception is thrown or not.
It is used to ensure that certain cleanup or finalization steps are performed regardless of whether an exception occurred.
