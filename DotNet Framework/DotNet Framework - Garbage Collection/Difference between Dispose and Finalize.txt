Question - What is difference between "Dispose" and "Finalize"?

Dispose Method:
The Dispose method is part of the IDisposable interface in C#. 
It is used to release and clean up unmanaged resources explicitly. 
The primary purpose is to allow an object to release resources before the object is reclaimed by the garbage collector.

Finalize Method (Destructor):
The Finalize method is a destructor in C# that is automatically called by the garbage collector before reclaiming the memory occupied by an object. 
It's part of the System.Object class and is used for cleanup operations before an object is garbage-collected.



Key Differences:
Dispose is called explicitly by the developer when an object is no longer needed.
Finalize is called automatically by the garbage collector before reclaiming the memory.
Dispose is typically called at a known point in the code, providing more control over when resources are released.
Finalize is invoked by the garbage collector, and the timing is not predictable.
Dispose is specifically designed for explicit resource cleanup, especially for managing unmanaged resources.
Finalize is a general-purpose cleanup mechanism but is not guaranteed to be called promptly.
Dispose is often used in conjunction with the using statement to ensure timely and deterministic cleanup.
Finalize is less commonly used directly, and relying on it as the sole mechanism for resource cleanup is discouraged.
