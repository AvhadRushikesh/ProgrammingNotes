Question - What are Generations in garbage collection?


Generational garbage collection is a memory management strategy used by modern garbage collectors to improve the efficiency of reclaiming memory.
In this approach, objects are categorized into different "generations" based on their age, and garbage collection is performed more frequently on younger generations.
The goal is to take advantage of the observation that many objects become unreachable shortly after being created.
In the context of generational garbage collection, the most common generations are:

Young Generation (Generation 0):
The young generation contains newly created objects.
Many objects in this generation are short-lived and become unreachable quickly.
Garbage collection is performed more frequently in the young generation.

Intermediate Generation (Generation 1):
The intermediate generation typically contains objects that have survived one or more garbage collection cycles in the young generation. 

Old Generation (Generation 2 or Tenured Generation):
The old generation contains long-lived objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles.
Objects in this generation are expected to be relatively stable and may persist for the entire duration of the program.
