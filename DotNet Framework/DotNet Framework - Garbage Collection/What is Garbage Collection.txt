Question - What is Garbage Collection (GC)?


Garbage Collection (GC) is an automatic memory management process used by modern programming languages,
including C#, Java, and others, to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.
The main purpose of garbage collection is to automatically identify and free up memory that is no longer reachable or referenced by the program,
preventing memory leaks and improving the overall efficiency of memory usage.
