Question - What is meant by Globalization and Localization?



globalization is the process of designing and developing software to be culturally and linguistically neutral,
while localization is the process of adapting a globalized application to a specific locale by translating text,
adjusting visual elements, and making cultural modifications.
Together, these processes enable software to be used by a diverse global audience,
fostering inclusivity and improving user experience across different regions and languages.
