Question - What are the important components of .NET Framework?

The .NET Framework is a comprehensive platform developed by Microsoft for building and running various types of applications.
It includes several important components that work together to provide a robust and versatile development environment.

components of the .NET Framework:
1.	Common Language Runtime (CLR):
•	It provides the execution environment for .NET applications.
    It handles memory management, code execution, security, and other runtime services.
2.	Base Class Library (BCL):
•	The BCL is a collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide core functionality for .NET applications.
    It includes classes for data structures, file I/O, networking, security, and more.
3.	Framework Class Library (FCL):
•	The FCL is an extension of the BCL and provides additional functionality specific to application development, including Windows Forms, ASP.NET for web development, ADO.NET for data access, and more.
4.	ASP.NET:
•	ASP.NET is a web development framework for building dynamic web applications and services.
    It supports the development of web forms, MVC patterns, and Web API for building RESTful services.
5.	ADO.NET:
•	ADO.NET is a set of classes for data access.
    It provides a way to interact with databases, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and manage database connections.
6.	Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF):
•	WPF is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications.
    It enables the creation of rich, interactive user interfaces with features like data binding, styling, and animation.
7.	Windows Communication Foundation (WCF):
•	WCF is a framework for building and consuming distributed services.
    It allows developers to create and consume services using various protocols, including HTTP, TCP, and MSMQ.
8.	Windows Workflow Foundation (WF):
•	WF is a framework for building workflow-enabled applications.
    It provides a set of tools and APIs for defining, executing, and managing workflows.
9.	Language Integrated Query (LINQ):
•	LINQ is a set of language features that enable querying data using a SQL-like syntax directly within C# or VB.NET code.
    It provides a unified way to query various data sources, including collections, databases, and XML.
10.	Entity Framework:
•	Entity Framework is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database interactions. 
    It allows to work with databases using .NET objects.
11.	Common Type System (CTS):
•	CTS defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the. 
    It ensures type compatibility across languages that target the .NET platform.
12.	Common Intermediate Language (CIL):
•	CIL, also known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), is an intermediate language that the .NET languages are compiled into. 
    It is executed by the CLR.
13.	Global Assembly Cache (GAC):
•	The GAC is a centralized repository for storing and managing shared assemblies (libraries) that multiple applications can use.
    It helps in versioning and avoids version conflicts.
14.	Visual Studio:
•	While not part of the .NET Framework itself, Visual Studio is the primary integrated development environment (IDE) used for creating, debugging, and deploying .NET applications.
