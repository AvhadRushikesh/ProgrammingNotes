Question - What are the alternative ways of if-else conditions? When to use what?

In C#, if-else conditions are the standard way to make decisions in your code. 
However, there are alternative ways and constructs that you can use based on the complexity and readability requirements of your code.

1. Ternary Operator (? :):
    The ternary operator is a concise way to express a simple conditional statement in a single line.
    It has the form 
    condition ? true_expression : false_expression.
    When to use:
    Use the ternary operator when you have a simple condition and the expressions are short.
    It enhances code readability for simple decisions.

2. Switch Statement:
    The switch statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed. 
    It is useful when you have multiple conditions to check against the same variable.
    When to use:
    Use the switch statement when you have multiple conditions to check against the same variable.
    It enhances code readability and maintainability in such scenarios.
