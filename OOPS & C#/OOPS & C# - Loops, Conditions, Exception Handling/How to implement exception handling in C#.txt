Question - How to implement Exception handling in C#?

Exception handling in C# is a way to gracefully manage runtime errors and unexpected situations in your code. 
It involves using try, catch, finally, and optionally throw blocks. 

Here's a basic structure for implementing exception handling in C#:
Explanation of the components:
1.	try Block:
•	The try block contains the code that might throw an exception.
    If an exception occurs within this block, the runtime searches for a corresponding catch block to handle the exception.
2.	catch Blocks:
•	Each catch block specifies a type of exception that it can handle.
    If an exception of that type occurs in the try block, the corresponding catch block is executed.
    You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
3.	finally Block:
•	The finally block contains code that is guaranteed to execute, whether an exception occurs or not.
    This block is optional, and you can omit it if you don't need specific cleanup or finalization code.
4.	throw Statement:
•	The throw statement is used to manually throw an exception.
    You can use this statement to create custom exceptions or to propagate exceptions that you catch.
