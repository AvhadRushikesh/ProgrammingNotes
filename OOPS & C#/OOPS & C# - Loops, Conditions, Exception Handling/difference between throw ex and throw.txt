Question - What is the difference between “throw” and “throw ex”?

In C#, both throw ex and throw are used to throw exceptions, but they behave differently in the context of exception handling.

When you use throw ex, you are re-throwing the original exception caught in the catch block. 
This means that the call stack information, including the point where the original exception was thrown, is preserved. 
This can be useful for debugging, as it provides more information about the origin of the exception.

When you use throw without an argument (throw;), you are re-throwing the original exception without resetting the call stack. 
This means that the exception retains its original source information, making it easier to trace back to where it was initially thrown.
