Question - What is the difference between Continue and Break Statement?

In C#, break and continue are control flow statements used within loops to alter the normal flow of execution.

break Statement:
The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.
When encountered, the break statement terminates the loop immediately, and control is transferred to the statement
break is commonly used when a loop needs to be terminated prematurely based on a specific condition.

continue Statement:
The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and jump to the next iteration of the loop. 
It does not terminate the entire loop but skips the remaining code in the current iteration.
continue is commonly used when you want to skip a specific iteration of the loop based on a certain condition without terminating the entire loop.
