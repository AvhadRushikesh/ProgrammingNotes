Question - Can we execute multiple catch blocks?

In C#, only one catch block is executed for a given exception.
Once an exception is caught by the first catch block that matches its type, the control immediately transfers to that block, 
and subsequent catch blocks are skipped. 
This behavior is consistent with the flow of execution in the catch blocks.
It's important to order the catch blocks from the most specific exception types to the more general ones. 
This ensures that more specific exceptions are caught and handled before more general catch blocks. 
If you reverse the order, putting a more general catch block before a more specific one,
the specific catch block will never be reached because the more general catch block will match the exception first.
