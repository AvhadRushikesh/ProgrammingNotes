Question - What is the difference between Finally and Finalize?

finally:
The finally block is part of the exception handling mechanism in C#. 
It is used within a try-catch structure to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. 
The finally block is optional, but if present, the code within it will be executed whether an exception occurs or not.

Finalize:
Finalize is a method provided by the .NET Framework for automatic memory management using the garbage collector.
It is not directly called by the developer but is invoked by the garbage collector when an object is being reclaimed. 
The Finalize method is a member of the System.Object class and can be overridden in a user-defined class to provide custom cleanup operations before an object is destroyed.
