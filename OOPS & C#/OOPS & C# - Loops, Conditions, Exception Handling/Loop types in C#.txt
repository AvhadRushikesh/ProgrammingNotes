Question - What are the Loop types in C#? When to use what in real applications?

In C#, there are several types of loops that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. 

The common loop types in C# include:
1.	for Loop:
•	The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance.
    It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment or decrement expression.
    Use the for loop when the number of iterations is known and you need precise control over the loop variables.
2.	while Loop:
•	The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition is true.
    Use the while loop when the number of iterations is not predetermined, and the loop continues based on a specific condition.
3.	do-while Loop:
•	The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once, as the condition is checked after the loop body.
    Use the do-while loop when you want to ensure that the loop body is executed at least once, regardless of the initial condition.
4.	foreach Loop:
•	The foreach loop is used to iterate over elements in a collection, such as arrays, lists, or other enumerable types.
    Use the foreach loop when iterating over elements in a collection, and you don't need to track an index explicitly.
