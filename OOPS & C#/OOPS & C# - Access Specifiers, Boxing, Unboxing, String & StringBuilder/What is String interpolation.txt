Question - What is String Interpolation in C#?

String interpolation in C# is a feature that allows you to embed expressions directly into string literals, 
making the process of creating formatted strings more concise and readable. 
It simplifies the concatenation of strings with variables, eliminating the need for explicit string concatenation operators (+) or methods 
like String.Format.
String interpolation is achieved by prefixing a string literal with the $ symbol,
and expressions within curly braces {} are evaluated and replaced with their values at runtime.
String interpolation is a concise and expressive way to create formatted strings, 
and it's widely used in modern C# code. 
It improves code readability and reduces the likelihood of formatting errors compared to traditional string concatenation or String.Format methods.
