Question - Which one is explicit Boxing or Unboxing?

The terms "explicit boxing" and "explicit unboxing" refer to specific operations in C# when converting between value types and reference types. 


Explicit Boxing: 
Explicit boxing is the process of manually converting a value type to an object reference using a cast or the object keyword. 
This operation is explicit because the developer is explicitly indicating the conversion.

Explicit Unboxing: 
Explicit unboxing is the process of manually converting an object reference back to a value type using a cast. 
This operation is explicit because the developer is explicitly indicating the conversion.
