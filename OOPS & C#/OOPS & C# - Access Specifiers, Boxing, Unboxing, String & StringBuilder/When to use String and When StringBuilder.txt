Question - When to use String and when StringBuilder in real application?


Use String when:
1.	Immutable Content:
•	If the content of the string is mostly fixed and doesn't change frequently, using the String class is appropriate.
2.	Few Modifications:
•	If you are performing a limited number of string operations and the content is not frequently modified, 
    using the String class is straightforward and sufficient.
3.	Readability and Simplicity:
•	When the code involves simple string concatenation and readability is a priority, 
    using the String class directly can make the code more straightforward.

Use StringBuilder when:
1.	Frequent Modifications:
•	If the content of the string needs to be modified frequently, especially in loops or dynamic scenarios, 
    using StringBuilder can be more efficient and result in better performance.
2.	Looping or Iterative Operations:
•	In scenarios where strings are constructed in loops, StringBuilder is more efficient because it avoids the creation of multiple string objects.
3.	Performance is a Concern:
•	If your application involves extensive string manipulations and performance is critical, 
    using StringBuilder can help minimize memory allocations and improve efficiency.
