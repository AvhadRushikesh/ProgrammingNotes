Question - What is internal access modifier? Show example.

In C#, 
the internal access modifier is used to specify that a class, method, property, or other member is only accessible within the same assembly. 
Members marked as internal can be accessed by any code within the same assembly but are not accessible from outside assemblies.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of the internal access modifier:

csharpCopy code

// Assembly A
// File: MyClass.cs

using System;
namespace AssemblyA
{
    internal class InternalClass
    {
        internal void InternalMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is an internal method.");
        }
    }
}
In this example, 
the InternalClass class and its InternalMethod method are marked as internal. 
This means they can be accessed by other classes within the same assembly (AssemblyA), but they cannot be accessed from outside assemblies.

Now, let's create another assembly (AssemblyB) and try to access the InternalClass from there:

csharp
Copy code
// Assembly B
// File: AnotherClass.cs

using AssemblyA;
namespace AssemblyB
{
    public class AnotherClass
    {
        public void TryAccessInternalClass()
        {
            // Attempting to create an instance of InternalClass from another assembly will result in a compilation error.
            // InternalClass internalInstance = new InternalClass(); // Compilation error
            // internalInstance.InternalMethod(); // Compilation error
        }
    }
}
In this example, 
the AnotherClass in AssemblyB attempts to create an instance of InternalClass and call its InternalMethod. 
However, this will result in compilation errors because these members are marked as internal and are not accessible from outside the AssemblyA.

The internal access modifier is useful for encapsulating implementation details within an assembly,
while still allowing access to those details within the same assembly. 
It helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and promoting a clean architecture within the assembly.
