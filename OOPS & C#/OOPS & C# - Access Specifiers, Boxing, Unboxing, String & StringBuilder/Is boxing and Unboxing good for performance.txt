Question - Is Boxing and Unboxing good for performance?

Boxing and unboxing in C# can have a performance impact, and in performance-critical scenarios,
it's generally advisable to be mindful of these operations and consider alternatives.
The performance considerations stem from the fact that boxing involves creating a new object on the heap,
and unboxing involves extracting a value from an object on the heap.

while boxing and unboxing provide flexibility in certain scenarios, they can have performance implications.
It's crucial to be aware of these implications, especially in performance-critical code.

Whenever possible, consider using alternatives that minimize or eliminate the need for explicit boxing and unboxing,
such as generic collections and appropriate use of value types.
