Question - What is default access modifier in a class?

In C#, 
the default access modifier for a class is internal. 
If you declare a class without specifying an access modifier, it is considered internal by default. 
This means that the class is accessible within the same assembly but not from outside assemblies.

Here's an example:
csharpCopy code
// This class is internal by default 
class MyClass 
{ 
    // Members of the class 
}

In the example above, 
MyClass is implicitly marked as internal because no access modifier is specified.
If this class is part of an assembly, it can be accessed by other types within the same assembly but not from types in external assemblies.
