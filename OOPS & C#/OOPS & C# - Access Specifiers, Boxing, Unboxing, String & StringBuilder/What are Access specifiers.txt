Question - What are Access Specifiers?

Access specifiers, also known as access modifiers, 
are keywords in object-oriented programming languages that define the visibility and accessibility of classes,
methods, fields, and other members within a program. 

Access specifiers determine how the elements of a class can be accessed by other classes or code outside the current class.

In C#, there are four primary access specifiers:
1.	public:
•	Members declared as public are accessible from any other class or assembly. 
    This is the least restrictive access level.
2.	private:
•	Members declared as private are only accessible within the same class. 
    This is the most restrictive access level.
3.	protected:
•	Members declared as protected are accessible within the same class and by derived classes. 
    It restricts access from outside the class.
4.	internal:
•	Members declared as internal are accessible within the same assembly but not from outside assemblies.
5.	protected internal:
•	Allows access within the same assembly or by derived classes.
