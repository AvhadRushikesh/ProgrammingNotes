Question - Difference between Pass by value and Pass by Reference?

In C#, when you pass a parameter to a method, you can pass it by value or by reference.


Pass by Value:
1.	What happens:
•	When you pass a parameter by value, a copy of the actual value is passed to the method. 
    Any changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original variable.
2.	Syntax:
•	Parameters are passed by value by default in C#.

Pass by Reference:
1.	What happens:
•	When you pass a parameter by reference, the memory address (reference) of the actual variable is passed to the method.
    Any changes made to the parameter inside the method directly affect the original variable.
2.	Syntax:
•	You use the ref keyword when defining the method parameter and when calling the method.
