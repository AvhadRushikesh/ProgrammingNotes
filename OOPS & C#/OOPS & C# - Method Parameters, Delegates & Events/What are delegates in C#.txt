Question - What are delegates in C#? When to use delegates in real applications?

A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific signature.
It is similar to a function pointer in C or C++.
Delegates allow you to treat methods as first-class objects, enabling you to pass methods as parameters, return them from methods, and store them in data structures.


Use Cases for Delegates:
Delegates are commonly used for implementing event handling in C#.: 
Delegates are useful for implementing callback mechanisms where a method can be passed as an argument to another method.
Delegates are essential for working with LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and functional programming features in C#.
Delegates are used in asynchronous programming, especially with the BeginInvoke and EndInvoke methods.
