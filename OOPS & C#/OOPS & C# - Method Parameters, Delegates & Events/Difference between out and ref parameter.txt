Question - What is difference between "out" and "ref" parameters?

Both ref and out parameters allow methods to modify the value of the argument and have the changes reflected outside the method.

ref parameters require the variable to be initialized before the method call,
while out parameters do not.

ref parameters allow two-way communication, passing the initial value to the method and reflecting any changes back to the calling code.

out parameters are designed for one-way communication, where the initial value is not used by the method, and the method must assign a value to the parameter before it returns.
