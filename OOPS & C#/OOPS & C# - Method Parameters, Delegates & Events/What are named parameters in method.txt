Question - What are named parameters in a method?

Named parameters in a method allow you to explicitly specify the names of parameters when calling the method.
Named parameters are a helpful feature, especially in situations where a method has many parameters, optional parameters, or when you want to make the method call more self-explanatory. 
They can enhance the clarity of code, improve maintainability and reduce the chance of errors due to parameter misalignment.
