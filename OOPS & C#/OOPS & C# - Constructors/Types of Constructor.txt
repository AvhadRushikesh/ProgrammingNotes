Question - What are the types of Constructor?

In C#, 
Constructors can be categorized into several types based on their characteristics and usage.

The main types of constructors are:
1. Default Constructor:
•	A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters. 
    It is automatically provided by the compiler if no constructors are explicitly defined in the class.
2. Parameterized Constructor:
•	A parameterized constructor accepts parameters, allowing you to pass values at the time of object creation.
3. Copy Constructor:
•	A copy constructor creates a new object by copying the properties or values of an existing object. 
    It is used to clone an object.
4. Static Constructor:
•	A static constructor is used to initialize static members of a class. 
    It is called only once, before any static members are accessed or any static methods are called.
•	Static constructors do not take any access modifiers, and you cannot have parameters for a static constructor.
5. Private Constructor:
•	A private constructor is used to prevent the instantiation of a class from outside the class itself.
    It is often used in the implementation of singleton patterns.
6. Chained Constructor (Constructor Overloading):
•	Chained constructors allow a constructor to call another constructor within the same class. 
    This is known as constructor overloading.
