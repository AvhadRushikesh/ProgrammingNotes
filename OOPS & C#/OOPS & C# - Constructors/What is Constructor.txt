Question - What is Constructor? When to use Constructor in real applications?

A constructor in C# is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. 
It has the same name as the class and is used to initialize the object's state and perform any necessary setup.
Constructors play a crucial role in the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, providing a means to ensure that an object is properly initialized before it is used.
A constructor has the same name as the class it belongs to.
Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. 
They are implicitly assumed to return an instance of the class.
Constructors contain initialization code that sets the initial state of an object.
A constructor with no parameters is called a default constructor. 
It is automatically provided by the compiler if no constructors are explicitly defined in the class.
Constructors can accept parameters, allowing you to pass values at the time of object creation.

When to Use Constructors in Real Applications:
Constructors are used to initialize the state of an object, setting its initial values or configuring its properties.
Constructors are commonly used in dependency injection to pass dependencies to a class at the time of instantiation.
Constructors are used for resource allocation, such as opening connections, acquiring handles, or initializing data structures.
When there is specific logic that needs to be executed at the time of object creation, constructors provide a suitable place for such custom initialization.
In real applications, constructors are fundamental for ensuring that objects are in a valid and usable state when created. 
They enable the encapsulation of initialization logic, making code more organized, maintainable, and robust.
Constructors are essential for the proper functioning of classes in an object-oriented system.
