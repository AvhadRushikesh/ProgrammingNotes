Question - What is destructor?

In C#, 
a destructor is a special method in a class that is used to clean up resources held by an object before it is destroyed or garbage-collected.
It is the counterpart to a constructor, which is used for initializing an object.
A destructor is defined using the tilde (~) followed by the class name and is called automatically when an object is no longer reachable and is being finalized by the garbage collector.
