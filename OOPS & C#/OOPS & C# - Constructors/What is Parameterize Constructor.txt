Question - What is Parameterize Constructor?

In C#, 
a parameterized constructor is a type of constructor that accepts parameters during its declaration. 
Unlike a default constructor, which has no parameters, a parameterized constructor allows you to pass values to initialize the object's state when an instance of the class is created.
The main purpose of a parameterized constructor is to enable you to provide specific values at the time of object creation, allowing for more flexibility and customization of object initialization.
