Question - Can we have parameters or access modifiers in static constructor?

a static constructor does not allow parameters or access modifiers.
The static constructor is automatically called by the runtime before any static members of the class are accessed or any static methods are called. 
It is implicitly private and parameterless, and you cannot explicitly define access modifiers or parameters for it.
