Question - What is default Constructor?

In C#, 
a default constructor is a special type of constructor that is automatically provided by the compiler if a class doesn't explicitly define any constructor. 
A default constructor has no parameters, and its purpose is to initialize the object's state with default values.
The default constructor is called when an instance of the class is created without providing any explicit arguments.
It ensures that the object is in a valid state by setting initial values for its fields or properties.
If a class does not have any constructor defined, the compiler automatically generates a default constructor.
When you create an instance of the class, the default constructor is called implicitly:
If you explicitly define any constructor in a class, the compiler does not generate a default constructor unless you explicitly include it in your code. 

Default constructors are essential for ensuring that objects are initialized properly, especially when instances of a class are created without specifying explicit values. 
They help maintain the integrity and consistency of the object's state.
