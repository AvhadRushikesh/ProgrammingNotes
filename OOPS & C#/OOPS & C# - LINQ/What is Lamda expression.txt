Question - What is the lambda expression ?  What is the use in real applications?

Lambda expressions in C# are a concise way to represent anonymous methods or functions.
They provide a shorthand syntax for writing functions in a more compact form, especially for short-lived operations.
Lambda expressions are often used in LINQ queries, event handling, and functional programming scenarios.

Use Cases in Real Applications:
1.	LINQ Queries:
•	Lambda expressions are commonly used in LINQ queries for specifying conditions, projections, and ordering.
2.	Event Handling:
•	Lambda expressions are often used for defining event handlers in a more concise way.
3.	Asynchronous Programming:
•	In asynchronous programming, lambda expressions are used with asynchronous delegates and tasks.
