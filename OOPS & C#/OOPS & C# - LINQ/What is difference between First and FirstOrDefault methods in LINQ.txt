Question - What is difference between First and FirstOrDefault methods in LINQ ?

In LINQ, both the First and FirstOrDefault methods are used to retrieve the first element from a sequence that satisfies a specified condition. 

However, there is a key difference between the two:
1. First Method:
•	Usage:
•	First is used to return the first element that satisfies the specified condition in a sequence.
•	Behavior:
•	If no matching element is found, First will throw an InvalidOperationException.
    This method assumes that at least one element should exist in the sequence to satisfy the condition.

2. FirstOrDefault Method:
•	Usage:
•	FirstOrDefault is used to return the first element that satisfies the specified condition in a sequence,
    or a default value if no such element is found.
•	Behavior:
•	If no matching element is found, FirstOrDefault will return the default value for the element type 
    (e.g., null for reference types, 0 for numeric types) instead of throwing an exception.
    This method is useful when it's acceptable for the sequence to be empty.
