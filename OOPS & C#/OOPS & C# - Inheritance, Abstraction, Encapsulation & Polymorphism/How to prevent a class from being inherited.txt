Question - How to prevent a class from being inherited?

In C#, you can prevent a class from being inherited by using the sealed modifier. 
When you mark a class as sealed, it means that it cannot be used as a base class for other classes, 
and it cannot be inherited.

Here's an example:
sealed class SealedClass

{
	// Class members & Methods go here
}

In this example, 
the SealedClass is marked as sealed, which prevents other classes from inheriting from it.
If you try to derive a class from SealedClass, the compiler will generate an error.

// This will result in a compilation error 
class AnotherClass : SealedClass 
{
 	// Class members and methods for AnotherClass 
}
