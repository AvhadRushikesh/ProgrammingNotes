Question - Method is Marked as Virtual, do we have to Override it from the child class?

In C#, 
when a method is marked as virtual in a base class, 
it means that the method is designed to be overridden in derived classes. However, it is not mandatory for derived classes to override a virtual method. A virtual method provides the option for a derived class to provide its own implementation, but it doesn't enforce that every derived class must override it.

Here's a brief explanation:
1.	Virtual Method in Base Class:
•	A virtual method in a base class is marked with the virtual keyword.

csharpCopy code
public class Animal 
{ 
    public virtual void MakeSound() 
    { 
        Console.WriteLine("Some generic sound"); 
    }
}

2.	Option to Override:
•	The virtual keyword indicates that the method can be overridden in a derived class,
    but it doesn't require it.
    A derived class has the option to provide its own implementation by using the override keyword.

    csharp code
    public class Dog : Animal
    { 
        public override void MakeSound() 
        { 
            Console.WriteLine("Bark!"); 
        } 
    }

3.	Not Overriding the Virtual Method:
•	It's perfectly valid for a derived class not to override a virtual method.
    If a derived class doesn't provide its own implementation, 
    it will inherit and use the base class's implementation.

    csharpCopy code
    public class Cat : Animal 
    { 
        // The MakeSound method is not overridden 
    }

4.	Calling the Base Class Implementation:
•	If a derived class chooses not to override a virtual method, 
    it can still call the base class's implementation using the base keyword.
    csharpCopy code
    public class Cat : Animal 
    { 
        public void SomeMethod() 
        { 
            // Call the base class's implementation 
            base.MakeSound();
        } 
    }

In summary, 
while marking a method as virtual in a base class allows derived classes to override it, 
it doesn't mandate that every derived class must provide its own implementation. 
The decision to override a virtual method depends on the specific requirements of the derived class. 
If a derived class doesn't override the virtual method, it inherits and uses the base class's implementation.
