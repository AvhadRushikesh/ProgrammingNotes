Question - What is abstraction? How to implement abstraction in real application?

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering,
that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors,
while hiding the irrelevant details.
It is a way to manage complexity by focusing on the essential aspects of an object or system, and ignoring the non-essential details.

In programming, 
abstraction is typically implemented using abstract classes and interfaces. 

Here are some key concepts related to abstraction and how to implement them in real applications:
1.	Abstract Classes:
•	An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and often contains abstract methods (methods without a body) 
    that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses.
•	Abstract classes can also have concrete methods that provide a default implementation, 
    which can be overridden by subclasses.
