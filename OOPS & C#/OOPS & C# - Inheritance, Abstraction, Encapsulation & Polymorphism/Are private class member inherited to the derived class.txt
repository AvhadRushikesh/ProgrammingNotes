Question - Are the private class members inherited to the derived class?

No,
private class members are not inherited by derived classes in C#.
Inheritance in C# involves the accessibility of members, and private members are not accessible outside the class in which they are declared.

Here's an example to illustrate this:
public class BaseClass 
{ 
 	private int privateField = 42; 
 	public void DisplayPrivateField() 
 	{ 
 		Console.WriteLine(privateField); 
 	} 
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass 
{ 
 	// The DerivedClass cannot access privateField directly 
 	// If you try to uncomment the line below, it will result in a compilation error: 
 	// privateField is inaccessible due to its protection level 
 	// privateField = 10; 
 	public void DisplayPrivateFieldFromDerived() 
 	{
 		// The derived class can access private members of the base class 
 		// through public or protected methods. 
 		DisplayPrivateField(); 
 	} 
}
 
class Program 
{ 
 	static void Main() 
 	{ 
 		DerivedClass derivedObject = new DerivedClass(); 
 		// This will work because DisplayPrivateField is a public method 
 		// in the BaseClass that internally accesses the private field. 
 		derivedObject.DisplayPrivateFieldFromDerived(); 
 	} 
}

In this example, privateField is a private member of BaseClass.
The DerivedClass cannot directly access or inherit this private field.
However, it can access it through public or protected methods defined in the base class, as demonstrated by the DisplayPrivateFieldFromDerived method.
Private members are not inherited, and they are not directly accessible in derived classes.
Access to private members is typically controlled through public methods or properties provided by the base class.
