Question - What is the difference between Abstraction and Abstract class?

Abstraction:
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential characteristics and behaviors, 
while ignoring or hiding unnecessary details.

Abstract Class:
An abstract class is a class in C# that cannot be instantiated directly.
It is marked with the abstract keyword and may contain abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) members, such as methods, properties, and fields.
