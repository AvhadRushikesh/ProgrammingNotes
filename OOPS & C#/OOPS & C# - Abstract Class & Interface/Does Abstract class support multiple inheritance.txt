Question - Does Abstract class support multiple Inheritance?

In C#, an abstract class supports single inheritance only.
This means that a class can inherit from only one abstract class.
Unlike some other object-oriented programming languages that support multiple inheritance, C# chooses to avoid the complexities and ambiguities associated with it.
If you need to achieve functionality similar to multiple inheritance, you can use interfaces in combination with abstract classes.
While an abstract class provides a common base implementation, interfaces allow a class to declare multiple contracts.
