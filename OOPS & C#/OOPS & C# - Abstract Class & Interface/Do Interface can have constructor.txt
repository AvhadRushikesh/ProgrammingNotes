Question - Do Interface can have Constructor?

In C#, interfaces cannot have constructors.
The purpose of an interface is to define a contract that classes must adhere to,
specifying a set of method signatures, properties, events, or indexers.
An interface is not intended to contain any implementation details, including constructors.

If you need to initialize members or perform some kind of setup when an implementing class is instantiated, 
you should use a constructor in the implementing class, not in the interface.
Interfaces are focused on defining a contract, and the responsibility for providing a constructor (and its implementation) lies with the classes that implement the interface. 
The absence of constructors in interfaces encourages a separation of concerns and a cleaner design by contract.
