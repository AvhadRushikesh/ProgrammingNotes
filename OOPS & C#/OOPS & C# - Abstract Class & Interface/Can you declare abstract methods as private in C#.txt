Question - Can you declare abstract methods as private in C#?

In C#, abstract methods cannot be declared as private.
The accessibility modifier for abstract methods in C# must be at least as accessible as the containing abstract class or interface.
This means that abstract methods in an abstract class or interface cannot have less restrictive access modifiers than the containing class or interface.

Abstract methods are meant to be implemented by derived classes, and making them private would prevent any derived class from providing an implementation, which defeats the purpose of abstraction. 
Therefore, abstract methods in C# are typically declared with at least internal, protected, or public accessibility, depending on the intended visibility within the inheritance hierarchy.
