Question - What are the classes and objects?

Class:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines a data type by specifying the attributes (data members) and behaviors (methods or functions) that objects of the class will have.
The class serves as a model from which objects are created.

Object:
An object is an instance of a class.
It is a concrete realization of the attributes and behavior defined by a class.
Objects are created from classes, and each object has its own unique set of attribute values.
Objects can interact with each other by invoking each other's methods.


Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in OOP,
providing a way to model and organize code based on real-world entities and their interactions.
