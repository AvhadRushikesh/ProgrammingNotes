Question - What is OOPS? What are the main concepts of OOPS?

OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
It is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects" to organize and structure code.

The main concepts of OOP include:
1.	Classes and Objects:
•	Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
•	Object: An instance of a class.

2.	Encapsulation:
•	Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. 

3.	Inheritance:
•	Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class.

4.	Polymorphism:
•	Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
    Polymorphism can manifest in two forms: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).

5.	Abstraction:
•	It is the process of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary and relevant features of an object.
