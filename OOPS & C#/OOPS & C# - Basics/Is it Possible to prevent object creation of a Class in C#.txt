Question - Is it possible to prevent object creation of a class in C#?

Yes,
it is possible to prevent the creation of objects of a class in C# by using the private constructor or by making the class itself
abstract or static.


Here's how you can achieve this:
1.	Private Constructor:
•	If you make the constructor of a class private, it becomes inaccessible from outside the class.
    As a result, objects cannot be created directly using the new keyword.
    This pattern is commonly used for utility classes that only contain static members.

    public class NoObjectCreation
    {
	    // Private constructor
	    private NoObjectCreation()
	    {
		    // Constructor logic, if any
	    }
	
	    // Static method to perform operations
	    public static void DoSomething()
	    {
		    Console.WriteLine(“Doing Something”);
	    }
    }

In this example,
you cannot create an instance of NoObjectCreation using new NoObjectCreation().
Instead, you can call the static method DoSomething directly.


2.	Abstract Class:
•	An abstract class can also prevent direct instantiation.
    If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated directly,
    and you need to create a derived class that provides implementations for any abstract members.

    public abstract class NoObjectCreationAbstract
    {
	    // Abstract method that must be implemented by derived classes
	    public abstract void DoSomething();
    }

In this example, 
you cannot create an instance of NoObjectCreationAbstract directly.
You need to create a derived class and provide an implementation for the abstract method.


3.	Static Class:
•	A static class can also prevent object creation because all members of a static class must be static, including the constructor.
    Static classes cannot be instantiated, and their members can be accessed directly using the class name.
    
    public static class NoObjectCreationStatic
    {
	    // Static method to perform operations
	    public static void DoSomething()
	    {
		    Console.WriteLine(“Doing Something”);
	    }
    }

In this example,
you cannot create an instance of NoObjectCreationStatic using new NoObjectCreationStatic().
Instead, you can call the static method DoSomething directly.
