Question - What is difference between ArrayList and Hashtable?

ArrayList: 
    ArrayList is used to store and manipulate a dynamic array of objects.
    AarrayList stores a list of objects, and elements are accessed by their index.
    It is not generic, which means it can store any type of object, and casting is required when retrieving elements.
    It maintains the order of elements as they are added.

Hashtable:
    Hashtable is used to store key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary.
    Hashtable stores key-value pairs, where each key must be unique, and values can be retrieved using their corresponding keys.
    It does not guarantee any specific order of the elements.
