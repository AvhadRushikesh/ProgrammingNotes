Question - What is the difference between IEnumerable and IQuerable?

IEnumerable is a fundamental interface for working with in-memory collections (e.g., arrays, lists, etc.).
It provides a simple iterator (IEnumerator) that allows you to traverse the elements of a collection sequentially.

IQueryable is designed for querying data from external data sources (e.g., databases, web services) in a way that allows for deferred execution and optimization of queries.
It extends IEnumerable and introduces additional functionality to support querying with expression trees.
