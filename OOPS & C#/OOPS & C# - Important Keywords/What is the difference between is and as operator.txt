Question - What is the difference between "is" and "as" operator?

In C#, 
the "is" and "as" operators are used for type checking and type casting, respectively.
The "is" operator is used for type checking.
It determines whether an object is of a specified type or a type derived from that specified type.
It returns a boolean value (true or false) based on whether the object is compatible with the specified type.

The "as" operator is used for explicit type casting.
It attempts to cast an object to a specified type, and if the cast is successful, it returns the object of the specified type;
otherwise, it returns null.
