Question - What is the difference between "Readonly" and "Constant" variable?

both 'readonly' and 'const' are used to create variables that cannot be modified after they have been assigned a value.
'const' variables must be initialized at the time of declaration.
'readonly' variables can be initialized at the time of declaration or within the constructor of the class.
'readonly' is suitable when you want a variable to be initialized at runtime, and its value may vary between different instances of the type.
