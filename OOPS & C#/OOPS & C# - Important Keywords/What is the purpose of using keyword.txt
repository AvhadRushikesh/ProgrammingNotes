Question - What is the purpose of using keyword in C#?

The using keyword is commonly used to import namespaces in C#.
This allows you to use types from those namespaces without having to fully qualify the type names.
The using statement is used for resource management, especially for types that implement the IDisposable interface.
It ensures that the Dispose method of the object is called when the code block is exited.
The using directive can also be used to import static members of a class.
This allows you to use static members without explicitly specifying the class name.
