Question - What is difference between 'var' and 'dynamic' in C#?

var:
    The var keyword is used for implicitly typed local variables, and the type of the variable is determined by the compiler at compile time.
    Once the type is determined, it cannot be changed.
var x = 10;    // Compiler infers that x is of type int
 
dynamic: 
    The dynamic keyword is used for variables whose type is determined at runtime.
    Dynamic typing allows you to write code that defers type checking until runtime, and the type can be changed dynamically during execution.
dynamic y = 10;    // Type is determined at runtime
y = “Hello”;       // Type can be changed dynamically
