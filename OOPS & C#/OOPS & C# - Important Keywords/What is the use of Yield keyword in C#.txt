Question - What is the use of Yield keyword in C#?

The yield keyword in C# is used in the context of iterator methods to create an iterator block.
Iterator methods enable you to iterate over a sequence of values without the need to create an explicit collection.
The yield keyword is particularly useful when working with large data sets or when you want to generate values on-the-fly.
The primary purpose of the yield keyword is to simplify the implementation of iterators. 
An iterator is a method, property, or indexer that contains a yield statement.
When the iterator is called, the yield statement is used to produce a sequence of values one at a time, and the state of the iterator is preserved between calls.
