Question - How does SignalR achieve real-time communication?


SignalR achieves real-time communication by establishing a persistent connection between the server and connected clients, 
enabling bidirectional communication.
SignalR establishes a persistent connection using various transport protocols,
allowing for efficient and real-time bidirectional communication between the server and connected clients.
This makes SignalR suitable for building applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications, 
live notifications, and collaborative editing platforms.
The library uses various transport protocols to facilitate this communication.

Here are the key components and steps involved in SignalR's real-time communication:
Connection Negotiation:
    When a client wants to establish a connection with the SignalR server, it initiates a negotiation process.
    This negotiation occurs through an HTTP handshake, during which the client and server agree on the most suitable transport protocol.
Transport Protocols:
    SignalR supports multiple transport protocols, and the choice of protocol depends on the capabilities of the client and server.
    The available protocols include:
    WebSockets:
        Provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection.
        It is the most efficient and low-latency option when supported by both the client and server.
    Server-Sent Events (SSE):
        Enables the server to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection.
        It is suitable for scenarios where WebSockets are not available.
    Long Polling:
        Involves the client making a request to the server and keeping the connection open until the server has new data to send or a timeout occurs.
        It is a fallback option when WebSockets and SSE are not supported.
Connection Establishment:
    Once the negotiation is complete and the transport protocol is determined, the SignalR connection is established.
    This connection remains open for the duration of the client's interaction with the server, allowing for continuous communication.
Hubs:
    SignalR uses the concept of hubs to organize communication.
    Hubs are high-level abstractions that define methods that can be called by clients and server.
    Clients can invoke methods on the server, and vice versa.
Method Invocation:
    Clients can call methods on the server by invoking hub methods.
    Similarly, the server can call methods on connected clients.
    This bidirectional method invocation is the basis for real-time communication.
Connection ID:
    Each client is assigned a unique connection ID when it connects to the SignalR server.
    This connection ID is used to address messages to specific clients, enabling targeted communication.
Groups:
    SignalR supports the concept of groups, allowing clients to subscribe to named groups.
    Messages can be broadcasted to all clients in a group, facilitating scalable communication for scenarios like chat applications.
Backplanes (Scale-out):
    SignalR provides support for backplanes, enabling the distribution of messages across multiple servers in a web farm.
    This enhances scalability by ensuring that messages are broadcasted to all connected clients, regardless of the server they are connected to.
