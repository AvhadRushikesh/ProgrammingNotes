Question - What is MediaTypeFormatter class in web API?


MediaTypeFormatter is a class in ASP.NET Web API that plays a crucial role in the content negotiation process.
It is responsible for serializing objects into the format specified by the requested media type and deserializing incoming requests into objects.
Essentially, MediaTypeFormatter handles the conversion between the .NET object representation and various media types, such as JSON or XML. 
When a Web API action returns an object, 
the MediaTypeFormatter is responsible for serializing that object into the appropriate format based on the requested media type (specified by the client in the request's Accept header).
