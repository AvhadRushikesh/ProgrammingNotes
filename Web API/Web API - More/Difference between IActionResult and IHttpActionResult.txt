Question - What is the difference between IActionResult and IHttpActionResult?


IActionResult (ASP.NET Core):
    IActionResult is an interface in ASP.NET Core MVC that represents the result of an action method.
    It provides a way to encapsulate the result that should be returned to the client.
    IActionResult includes various derived types representing different types of results, such as ViewResult, JsonResult, RedirectResult, etc.

IHttpActionResult (ASP.NET Web API):
    IHttpActionResult is an interface introduced in ASP.NET Web API (prior to ASP.NET Core) to represent the result of a Web API action.
    It provides a way to encapsulate the HTTP response that should be returned to the client.
