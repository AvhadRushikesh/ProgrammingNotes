Question - What is Content Negotiation in Web API?


Content Negotiation in Web API refers to the process by which the server selects the most appropriate representation of a resource
to send back to the client based on the client's preferences.
It allows clients and servers to communicate about the media types they support,
and the negotiation process helps determine the format of the data exchanged between them.
In the context of Web API,
content negotiation typically involves determining the media type (such as JSON or XML) 
and other formatting details (like character encoding) for the data that will be sent in the response.
