Question - What is the difference between HTTPResponseMessage and IHttpActionResult?


HttpResponseMessage and IHttpActionResult are both classes/interfaces used in ASP.NET Web API (now part of ASP.NET Core MVC/WebAPI) 
to represent HTTP responses, but they serve slightly different purposes.

HttpResponseMessage:
    HttpResponseMessage is a class that represents an HTTP response.
    It is used to create and return HTTP responses from Web API actions.
    You can use HttpResponseMessage to set various properties of the HTTP response, such as status code, headers, and content.

IHttpActionResult:
    IHttpActionResult is an interface introduced in Web API to provide a more abstract and testable way to return HTTP responses.
    It is typically used as the return type for Web API actions.
    IHttpActionResult provides a level of abstraction over the creation of HttpResponseMessage.
    It allows you to return different types of results, and Web API will handle the creation of the corresponding HttpResponseMessage.

Differences:
    HttpResponseMessage provides a lower-level abstraction where you have direct control over the HTTP response details.
    With HttpResponseMessage, testing might involve inspecting the properties of the returned HttpResponseMessage.
    HttpResponseMessage requires explicit configuration for each aspect of the HTTP response.
    IHttpActionResult provides a higher-level abstraction, allowing you to return results in a more expressive and testable way.
    IHttpActionResult makes it easier to unit test your Web API actions because it abstracts away the details of the HTTP response,
    and you can assert against the returned IHttpActionResult.
    IHttpActionResult includes convenience methods like Ok, NotFound, BadRequest, etc.,
    which simplify the process of returning common HTTP responses.
