Question - What are Response Codes in Web API?


In the context of Web API, response codes refer to the HTTP status codes that a server returns to the client as part of an HTTP response.
These status codes provide information about the result of the client's request and help communicate the status of the operation.

HTTP status codes are three-digit numeric codes that are grouped into five classes:

1xx (Informational):
    This class indicates that the client's request was received, continuing process.
2xx (Successful):
    This class indicates that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
3xx (Redirection):
    This class indicates that further action needs to be taken to complete the request, often indicating a redirect.
4xx (Client Error):
    This class indicates that the client seems to have made an error in its request.
5xx (Server Error):
    This class indicates that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.
