Question - What are the types of authentication techniques in WEB API?


Web API authentication is a crucial aspect of securing your API and ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access the resources.

API Key Authentication:  
    In API key authentication, a unique key is generated for each client or application that wants to access the API.
Basic Authentication:  
    Basic Authentication involves sending a username and password as part of the request headers.
Bearer Token Authentication (OAuth 2.0):  
    Bearer Token Authentication involves the use of access tokens. 
JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication:  
    JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. 
Windows Authentication: 
    Windows Authentication allows users to authenticate using their Windows credentials. 
Client Certificate Authentication:  
    Client certificate authentication involves validating the client's identity using an X.509 certificate.
Token-Based Authentication (Custom): 
    The server issues a token to the client upon successful authentication.
