Question - What are REST guidelines? What is the difference between REST and RESTful?


REST Guidelines:
    The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests.
    The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience,
    while the server is responsible for processing requests and managing resources.
    A uniform and consistent interface simplifies and decouples the architecture. 
    Resources are the key abstractions in a RESTful system. 
    Resources can have multiple representations, such as XML, JSON, or HTML. 

Difference Between "REST" and "RESTful":

REST:
    "REST" refers to the architectural style itself.
    It is a set of constraints and principles that guide the design of distributed systems for web-based communication.
RESTful:
    "RESTful" is an adjective used to describe systems or services that adhere to the principles of REST.
    When we say a service is RESTful, 
    it means that the service follows the guidelines and constraints of REST in its design and implementation.
