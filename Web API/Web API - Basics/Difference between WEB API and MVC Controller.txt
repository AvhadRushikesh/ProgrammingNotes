Question - What is the difference between WEB API & MVC Controller?


Web API is focused on building HTTP services that provide data in machine-readable formats,
while MVC controllers are part of the ASP.NET MVC framework and are used for building web applications that generate HTML content.

Web API:
	Designed for building HTTP services that can be consumed by various clients, including web browsers, mobile devices, and other servers.
	Primarily used for exposing data and services over HTTP in a format such as JSON or XML.
	Suited for building RESTful APIs that follow REST principles.
	Does not typically deal with rendering HTML views.

MVC Controller:
	Part of the ASP.NET MVC framework, used for handling HTTP requests and orchestrating the interaction between models and views.
	Responsible for processing user input, updating the model, and returning the appropriate view to the client.
	Deals with generating HTML content and rendering views.
