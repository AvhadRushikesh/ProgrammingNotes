Question - How to consume web API from a .NET MVC application?


Create a new .NET MVC project

Ensure that your project has the necessary dependencies to make HTTP requests.

In a .NET MVC project, you can use the HttpClient class, which is available in the System.Net.Http namespace.
If it's not already added, you can install it using NuGet:

use HttpClient to make HTTP requests to the Web API. 

For other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), you can use the corresponding methods of HttpClient (PostAsync, PutAsync, DeleteAsync, etc).

If the Web API returns JSON data, you'll need to deserialize the JSON response.
You can use the System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer or a third-party library like Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET) for this purpose.

Implement appropriate error handling to deal with network issues, server errors, or unexpected responses.

When you're done using the HttpClient, make sure to dispose of it to release resources.
One way to do this is by implementing the IDisposable interface in your controller or using the using statement.
