Question - What are WEB API Advantages over WCF and WEB SERVICES?


Web API is designed with RESTful principles, which emphasize a stateless, uniform, and resource-oriented approach.
It uses standard HTTP methods and URIs to perform operations on resources.
Web API is lightweight and follows a more straightforward design.
It is well-suited for scenarios where simplicity and ease of use are prioritized.

WCF and traditional web services (ASMX) often use SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for communication,
which can be more heavyweight and complex than RESTful approaches.
