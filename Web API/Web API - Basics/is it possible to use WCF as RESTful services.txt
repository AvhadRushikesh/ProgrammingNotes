Question - Is it possible to use WCF as RESTful Services?


Yes, it is possible to use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to create RESTful services.
WCF provides support for building RESTful services through the use of the WebHttpBinding and the WebHttpBehavior.
This allows you to expose services over HTTP using the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
WCF supports various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
The WebInvoke attribute on the operation specifies the HTTP method, response format (JSON, XML), and the URI template.
