Question - What is difference between REST API & WEB API?


Web API:
    "Web API" is a broad term that refers to any API exposed over the web using HTTP.
    It doesn't prescribe a specific architectural style or set of guidelines.

REST API:
    "REST API" specifically refers to APIs that follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
    REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and guidelines for designing networked applications.
