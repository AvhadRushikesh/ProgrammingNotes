Question - What is REST?


REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
This is an architectural pattern used for exchanging data over a distributed environment.
In Rest, there is something called Client and Server, and the data can be exchanged between the client and server over a distributed environment.
Distributed environment means the client can be on any platform like Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
and the server can also be on any platform like Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
The REST architectural pattern treats each service as a resource and a client can access those resources by using HTTP Protocol methods such as
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
