Question - What are the differences between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET web API?


ASP.NET MVC
    ASP.NET MVC Framework basically used to create a web application by following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern,
    in which we can build web pages.
    In ASP.NET MVC, the action method can return both data and view.
    It only returns data in JSON format using JsonResult
    All requests are mapped to the respective action method based on the action method names.
    Content negotiation is not supported.

ASP.NET Web API
    ASP.NET Web API Framework is used to develop Restful services that can be consumed by different clients.
    ASP.NET Web API Framework returns data in JSON, XML, or any other format based on the Accept header in the request.
    It does not return the view to the client.
    All requests are mapped to actions using HTTP verbs.
    Content-negotiation supported.

We can mix ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET MVC controller in a single project to handle advanced AJAX requests which may return data in JSON,
XML, or any other format, and build a full-blown HTTP service.
Typically, this will be called ASP.NET Web API self-hosting.
