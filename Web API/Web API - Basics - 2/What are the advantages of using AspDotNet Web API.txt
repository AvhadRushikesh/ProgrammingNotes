Question - What are the advantages of using ASP.NET Web API?


Using ASP.NET Web API has a number of advantages, but the core advantages are as follows:

1.  It supports all the HTTP features.
    That means you can use all the built-in HTTP Heapers such as Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, etc.
    and HTTP Status codes such as 500, 200, 404, etc., 
    and HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations
2.  It supports Attribute Routing which is good for SEO as well as user-friendly URLs.
3.  It supports content negotiation i.e. as per the client request, the server sends the response in that format (if possible).
    The Response is generated in JSON or XML format using MediaTypeFormatter
4.  It has the ability to be hosted in IIS as well as self-host outside of IIS
5.  Supports Model Binding and Validation.
