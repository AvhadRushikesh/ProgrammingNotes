Question - Why do we need to choose ASP .NET Web API?


Nowadays, a web application is not sufficient or enough to reach all its customers.
People are becoming very smart;
they are using different types of devices such as mobile, iPhones, tablets, etc. in their daily life.
These devices are having a lot of apps that makes their life easy.
In simple words, we can say that we are moving toward the apps world from the web.
So, if we want to expose our data (business data) to the browsers as well as to all these modern devices apps in a fast,
secure and simple way, then we should have an API that should be compatible with browsers as well as all these modern devices.
The ASP.NET WEB API is a great framework for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a broad range of clients including browsers,
mobiles, iPhones, and tablets.
