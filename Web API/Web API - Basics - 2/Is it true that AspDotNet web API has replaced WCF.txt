Question - Is it true that ASP.NET Web API has replaced WCF?


It’s not true.
It’s a misconception that ASP.NET Web API has replaced WCF.
ASP.NET Web API is just another way of building non-SOAP-based services, for example, plain XML or JSON string, etc.
Yes, ASP.NET Web API has some added advantages like utilizing the full features of HTTP 
(HTTP Built-in Header and HTTP Verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, HTTP Status codes such as 500, 200, 404, etc.) 
and reaching more clients such as mobile devices, Tables, IoTs, Browsers, etc.
But WCF is still a good choice for the following scenarios:
    
If you want to develop transport protocol-oriented services other than HTTP, such as TCP, UDP, Named Pipes, etc.
If HTTP only then go with Web API.
Message Queuing scenario using MSMQ
One-way communication or Duplex communication
