Question - What is ASP.NET Web API?

The term API stands for “Application Programming Interface”.
ASP.NET Web API is a framework, provided by Microsoft, which makes it easy to build Web APIs, i.e. HTTP based services.
The ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building Restful services on top of the .NET Framework.

These Web API services can be consumed by a variety of clients such as
Browsers
Mobile applications
Desktop applications
IOTs, etc.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that we can develop both Restful and Non-Restful Web Services using the ASP.NET Web API framework.
But mostly this framework is used to create RESTful services.
In short, this framework does not provide any specific architectural style for creating the services.
