Question - What is the difference between REST and SOAP?


Let us discuss the difference between the REST and SOAP service:

1.  SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2.  The SOAP is an XML-based protocol whereas REST is not a protocol rather it is an architectural pattern i.e. resource-based architecture.                         
3.  SOAP has specifications for both stateless and state-full implementation whereas REST is completely stateless.
4.  SOAP enforces message format as XML whereas REST does not enforce message format as XML or JSON.
5.  The SOAP message consists of an envelope that includes SOAP headers and a body to store the actual information we want to send whereas 
    REST uses the HTTP build-in headers (with a variety of media types) to store the information and uses the HTTP Methods such as 
    GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE  to perform CRUD operations.
6.  SOAP Performance is slow as compared to REST.
