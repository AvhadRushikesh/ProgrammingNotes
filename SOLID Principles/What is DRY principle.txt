Question - What is DRY principle?


DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle is a guiding principle that encourages developers to avoid duplicating code and to promote code reuse.
The goal is to write code in a way that common functionality is not repeated in multiple places, leading to a more maintainable, readable,
and efficient codebase.
