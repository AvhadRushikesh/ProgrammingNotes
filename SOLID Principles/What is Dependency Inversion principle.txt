Question - What is Dependency Inversion Principle?


The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and design.
It was introduced by Robert C. Martin to guide developers in creating more maintainable and flexible software.

The Dependency Inversion Principle consists of two key concepts:
high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions,
and abstractions should not depend on details;
details should depend on abstractions.

Here's a breakdown of the Dependency Inversion Principle:
High-level modules:
    These are modules or classes that contain the high-level policy or business rules of an application.
Low-level modules:
    These are modules or classes that implement the low-level details or specific implementations related to the application.
Abstractions:
    Interfaces or abstract classes that define a set of methods or contracts without specifying the details of their implementation.

The Dependency Inversion Principle suggests that high-level modules should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes),
and low-level modules should also depend on the same abstractions.
This way, the system becomes more flexible and decoupled.
Changes in the low-level modules (implementation details) do not affect the high-level modules as long as they adhere to the same abstractions.

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle,
you create a more modular and maintainable codebase, making it easier to extend and modify the system without causing widespread changes.
This principle is closely related to the concept of inversion of control (IoC),
where control flow is inverted compared to traditional procedural programming.
IoC containers and dependency injection frameworks are often used to implement the Dependency Inversion Principle in practice.
