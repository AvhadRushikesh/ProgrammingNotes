Question - What are the types of joins in SQL Server?


In SQL Server,
there are several types of joins that allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

The most common types of joins are:
1. INNER JOIN:
    The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
    The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
    The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
    The FULL JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in either the left or the right table records.
5. CROSS JOIN:
    The CROSS JOIN keyword returns the Cartesian product of the two tables,
    i.e., all possible combinations of rows.
    It does not require a matching condition.
6. SELF JOIN:
    A self-join occurs when a table is joined with itself.
    It is useful for hierarchical data or when relating records within the same table.
