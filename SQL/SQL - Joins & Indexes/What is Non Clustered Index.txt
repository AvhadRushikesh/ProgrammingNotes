Question - What is Non-Clustered Index?


A non-clustered index in SQL Server does not dictate the physical order of data rows in a table.
Instead, it provides a separate structure that contains a sorted list of references to the rows in the table.
This index allows for efficient retrieval of data based on the indexed columns without altering the physical order of the actual data rows in the table.
