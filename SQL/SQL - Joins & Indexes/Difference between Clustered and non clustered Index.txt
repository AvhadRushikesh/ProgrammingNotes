Question - What is the difference between Clustered and Non-Clustered Index?


Clustered Index:
    A clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table.
    The rows in the table are stored on disk in the same order as the index.
    There can be only one clustered index per table,
    as the physical order of rows can only be based on one column or a combination of columns.
    When a table has a clustered index, the data rows are organized based on the order of the clustered index key.

Non-Clustered Index:
    A non-clustered index does not affect the physical order of the data rows on disk.
    Instead, it creates a separate structure that holds a mapping between the index keys and the corresponding row identifiers 
    (typically, a pointer to the actual row).
    Multiple non-clustered indexes can be created on a table.
