Question - What are Triggers and types of triggers?


A trigger is a set of instructions or procedures that are automatically executed (triggered).
Triggers are often used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, or automate complex database actions.
The events that can activate a trigger include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or a combination of these operations.

Here are the main types of triggers:
1. DML Triggers (Data Manipulation Language Triggers):
    Associated with data manipulation language (DML) operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
2. DML Trigger Timing:
    BEFORE Triggers: Executed before the triggering event.
    AFTER Triggers: Executed after the triggering event.
3. INSTEAD OF Triggers:
    Typically associated with views rather than tables.
    Replaces the standard action of the triggering event (e.g., instead of an update, perform a different action).
4. DML Trigger Scope:
    ROW Triggers: Fired once for each affected row.
    STATEMENT Triggers: Fired once for each triggering statement, regardless of the number of rows affected.
5. Nested Triggers:
    FIRE_TRIGGERS Option: Specifies whether other triggers can be fired in response to the trigger's actions.
    ALLOW/NONE Option: Determines if nested triggers are allowed.
6. Logon/Logoff Triggers:
    Fired when a user logs on or logs off from a SQL Server instance.
    Auditing user logins and logouts.
    Enforcing security policies.
