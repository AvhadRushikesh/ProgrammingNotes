Question - What is Auto Increment / Identity column in SQL Server?

An auto-increment or identity column is a column that is typically used to generate a unique numeric value,
for each new row added to a table.
This is particularly useful as a primary key or a part of a primary key,
ensuring that each row in the table has a distinct identifier.
