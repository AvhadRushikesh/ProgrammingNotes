Question - What is Sub query or Nested query or Inner query in SQL?


In SQL, a subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query nested inside another query.
A subquery is enclosed within parentheses and is usually embedded within the WHERE, FROM, or SELECT clause of the main (outer) query.
The result of a subquery is used by the outer query to perform further operations.

There are two main types of subqueries: scalar subqueries and table subqueries.

1. Scalar Subquery:
    A scalar subquery is a subquery that returns a single value and is typically used within a comparison operator.
    It can be used in various parts of a SQL statement where a single value is expected.

2. Table Subquery:
    A table subquery is a subquery that returns a result set of rows and columns.
    It is used in situations where a set of values is expected, such as in the IN or EXISTS clauses.
