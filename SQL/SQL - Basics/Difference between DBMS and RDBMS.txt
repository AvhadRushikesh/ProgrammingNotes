Question - What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?


DBMS (Database Management System):
A Database Management System is software that allows users to interact with a database.
It provides an interface to interact with the database, manage data, and ensure data integrity.
DBMS can handle structured and unstructured data, but it doesn't necessarily enforce relationships between tables.
Relationships between tables are not explicitly defined or enforced by the system.
Referential integrity may not be supported.


RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
A Relational Database Management System is a type of DBMS that is based on the relational model.
It manages data in tables that are related to each other.
RDBMS enforces relationships between tables, supports SQL for data manipulation, and ensures data integrity through features like ACID properties.
RDBMS Strictly follows the relational model.
Data is organized in tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys.
Relationships between tables are explicitly defined and enforced. 
Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints are used to maintain referential integrity.
RDBMS Supports SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.
