Question - What is the difference between Primary key and Unique key?


Primary Key:
Must contain unique values, and no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.
Does not allow null values.
Every record in the table must have a value in the primary key column(s).
Each table can have only one primary key.
It is often associated with the main identifier for a table.
automatically creates a clustered index on the primary key column(s) to optimize data retrieval.

Unique Key:
Requires that values in the specified column(s) are unique.
Allows null values. However, if a column has a unique key constraint, only one null value is allowed.
Multiple unique keys can exist in a single table.
May or may not automatically create an index.
