Question - What is a Constraint in SQL? What are its types.


A constraint is a rule or condition applied to a column or a set of columns in a table to ensure the accuracy,
integrity, and reliability of the data stored in the database.
Constraints help define the relationships between tables and maintain the consistency of the data. 

Primary Key Constraint:
Ensures that a column or a set of columns uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Unique Constraint:
Ensures that all values in a column or a set of columns are unique.

Foreign Key Constraint:
Establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of one table in another table.

Check Constraint:
Enforces a condition that must be true for each row in a table.

Not Null Constraint:
Ensures that a column cannot contain null values.

Default Constraint:
Specifies a default value for a column when one is not provided in an INSERT statement.
