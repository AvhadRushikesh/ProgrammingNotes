Question - What is the difference between Having clause and Where Clause?

Both the WHERE clause and the HAVING clause are used to filter and retrieve data based on specified conditions.

WHERE Clause:
    The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before they are grouped and aggregated.
    It is used with non-aggregated (individual) column values.
    The WHERE clause appears after the FROM clause and before the GROUP BY clause (if used).
    The WHERE clause is primarily used for filtering rows based on individual column values.

HAVING Clause:
    The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG) applied to grouped rows.
    It is used with aggregated values.
    The HAVING clause appears after the GROUP BY clause (if used) and before the ORDER BY clause.
    The HAVING clause is used for filtering the results of aggregate functions after they have been applied to grouped rows.
