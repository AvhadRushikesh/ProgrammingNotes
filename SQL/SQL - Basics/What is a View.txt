Question - What is View?

A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. 
Unlike a regular table, a view does not store the data itself; instead, it is a saved SQL query that can be treated as if it were a table.
Views allow you to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and present a subset of data to users without exposing the underlying complexity of the database structure.
A view is defined using a SELECT statement that retrieves data from one or more tables or other views.
Once created, a view can be referenced in other queries, just like a table.
Views can simplify complex queries by encapsulating the logic in a reusable way.
Views can provide a security layer by allowing users to access only specific columns or rows of a table.
Views can abstract the underlying table structure, presenting a cleaner interface to users.
