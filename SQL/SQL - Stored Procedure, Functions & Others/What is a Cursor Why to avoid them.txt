Question - What is a Cursor? Why to avoid them?


A cursor in SQL is a database object that allows for the sequential processing of a result set,
typically within a stored procedure or a batch of SQL statements.
Cursors provide a way to iterate over the rows returned by a query and perform operations on each row one at a time.

why cursors should be avoided:
1. Cursors can have a significant impact on performance, especially in large datasets.
2. Cursors consume additional resources, both in terms of memory and processing power.
3. Cursors may acquire locks on the rows they are processing, leading to potential blocking issues.
4. Cursor-based logic can be more complex and harder to understand than set-based operations.
