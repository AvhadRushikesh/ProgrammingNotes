Question - What is the difference between Stored Procedure and Functions?


Stored Procedure:
    Stored procedures are used to group one or more SQL statements into a logical unit and can include control-of-flow language constructs 
    (like loops and conditionals).
    They are often used for performing a series of database operations or business logic.
    A stored procedure may or may not return a value.
    It can return multiple output parameters.
    Executed using the EXECUTE or EXEC keyword.
    Can be called from another stored procedure or a script.

Function:
    Functions are used to encapsulate a specific operation and return a single value.
    Functions must return a single value.
    Functions cannot return multiple output parameters.
    They called in SQL statements, SELECT queries, or WHERE clauses.
    Functions can be used in computed columns, the SELECT list, and WHERE clauses.
