Question - How to optimize a Store Procedure or SQL query?


Optimizing a stored procedure or SQL query is crucial for improving the performance of database operations.


Here are some general strategies and techniques to optimize stored procedures and queries:
1. Use Indexes:
    Ensure that appropriate indexes are created on columns used in WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions.
2. *Avoid SELECT :
    Specify only the columns that are necessary in the SELECT list rather than using SELECT *.
3. Limit the Result Set:
    Use the TOP, LIMIT, or FETCH clauses to limit the number of rows returned if you only need a subset of the results.
4. Minimize Joins:
    Reduce the number of JOIN operations if possible.
5. Avoid Functions in WHERE Clauses:
    Using functions in WHERE clauses can prevent the query optimizer from using indexes.
