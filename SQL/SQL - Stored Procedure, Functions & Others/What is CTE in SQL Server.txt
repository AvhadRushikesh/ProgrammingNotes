Question - What is CTE in SQL Server?


In SQL Server,
a Common Table Expression (CTE) is a named temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
CTEs provide a way to create a complex query that can be referred to multiple times within a larger query.
