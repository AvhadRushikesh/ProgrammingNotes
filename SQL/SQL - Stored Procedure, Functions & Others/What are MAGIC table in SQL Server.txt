Question - What are MAGIC tables in SQL server?


In SQL Server,
"magic tables" refer to special tables that are automatically created and populated by the system during the execution of triggers.
These tables provide access to the data affected by the triggering event (e.g., an INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) within the context of the trigger.
