Question - What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE and DROP commands?


DELETE 
    is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a condition specified in the WHERE clause.
    Syntax,
    DELETE FROM tableName WHERE CONDITION (columnName = value);

TRUNCATE
    is used to remove all rows from a table without specifying any conditions.
    It effectively removes all data from the table.
    Syntax,
    TRUNCATE TABLE tableName;

DROP
    is used to remove an entire database object, such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure.
    Syntax,
    DROP TABLE tableName;
