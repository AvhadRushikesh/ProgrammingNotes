Question - What is the difference between Scope Identity and @@Identity?

Scope Identity
SCOPE_IDENTITY() is limited to the current scope or session.
It returns the last identity value generated within the current scope
SCOPE_IDENTITY() is generally recommended over @@IDENTITY because it is less prone to errors and provides results limited to the current scope.

@@Identity
@@IDENTITY is not limited to the current scope.
It returns the last identity value generated for any table in any session on the current connection.
@@IDENTITY should be used with caution, especially in scenarios involving triggers, nested stored procedures, or multi-statement batches,
where it might not provide the expected result.
