Question - How do you push a Docker image to Docker hub?


To push a Docker image to Docker Hub, you need to follow these general steps.
Please note that you'll need to have a Docker Hub account and be logged in to Docker Hub on your local machine.

Steps:
Login to Docker Hub:
    Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
    Run the following command to log in to Docker Hub.
    docker login -u <username> -p <password>
    If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you may need to use a personal access token as the password.
    In that case, generate a token on the Docker Hub website and use it in place of the password.
Tag the Docker Image:
    Before pushing the image to Docker Hub, you need to tag it with your Docker Hub username and the repository name.
    The tag should include the Docker Hub username, the repository name, and optionally a version tag.
    docker tag local_image <username>/<repository>:tag
    For example:
    docker tag my_local_image myusername/myrepository:v1.0
Push the Docker Image:
    Once the image is tagged, you can push it to Docker Hub using the following command:
    docker push <username>/<repository>:tag
    For example:
    docker push myusername/myrepository:v1.0
    This command uploads the Docker image to your Docker Hub repository.
    The process may take some time depending on the size of the image and your internet connection speed.
Verify on Docker Hub:
    After the push is complete, visit the Docker Hub website, log in to your account, and navigate to the repository.
    You should see the pushed image listed there.
    Example Workflow:
    Here's a quick example using a concrete image:
    # Log in to Docker Hub
    docker login -u myusername -p mypassword
    # Tag the local image
    docker tag my_local_image myusername/myrepository:v1.0
    # Push the image to Docker Hub
    docker push myusername/myrepository:v1.0
    
Make sure that you replace the placeholder values with your actual Docker Hub credentials, image names, and version tags.
Additionally, ensure that the Docker image you want to push is built and available locally on your machine.
