Question - What is the purpose of Dockerfile?


A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image.
It serves as a blueprint for creating a reproducible and consistent environment for running an application inside a Docker container.
The primary purpose of a Dockerfile is to automate the process of creating Docker images by specifying the steps needed to set
up the environment and configure the application.


Here are the key purposes and components of a Dockerfile:
Base Image Selection:
    Specify the base image that serves as the starting point for building the container.
    This image typically includes a minimal operating system and runtime.
Application Setup:
    Install dependencies and libraries required by the application.
    This can include system packages, programming language runtimes, and other software components.
Application Code Copy:
    Copy the application source code and any necessary configuration files into the image.
    This ensures that the image contains the required files for running the application.
Environment Configuration:
    Set environment variables that configure the behavior of the application or runtime within the container.
Application Build:
    If the application requires compilation or build steps, such as compiling source code or assets,
    specify those build commands in the Dockerfile.
Expose Ports:
    Declare which network ports the container will use and expose to the host system.
    This is crucial for allowing communication with the containerized application.
Container Startup Command:
    Define the command that should be executed when the container starts.
    This is typically the command that launches the main process of the application.


Here's a simple example of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application:
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the application source code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

This Dockerfile specifies the base image, sets up the working directory, installs Node.js dependencies,
copies the application code, exposes a port, and defines the command to start the Node.js application.
When this Dockerfile is used to build an image, it creates a containerized environment for running the specified Node.js application.
