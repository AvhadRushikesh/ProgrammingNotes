Question - What is the differnece between a pull request and a branch?



A branch and a pull request (PR) are related concepts in Git,
but they serve different purposes in the collaborative development process.

Branch:
Definition:
    A branch is a separate line of development within a Git repository.
    It allows developers to work on features, bug fixes, or other changes without affecting the main codebase.
    Each branch represents an independent set of changes.
Purpose:
    Branches are created to work on specific features, fixes, or experiments without disrupting the stability of the main codebase.
    They allow parallel development, enabling multiple developers to work on different tasks simultaneously.
Usage:
    Developers create branches using commands like git branch and switch between branches using git checkout or git switch.
    Changes made in a branch are isolated until the branch is merged back into another branch (e.g., the main branch).

Pull Request:
Definition:
    A pull request is a feature provided by Git hosting services (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) 
    that enables developers to propose changes from one branch (usually a feature branch)
    to another (often the main branch).
    It is a request to merge the changes in the source branch into the target branch.
Purpose:
    Pull requests facilitate code review and collaboration.
    Before changes are merged, other team members can review the proposed modifications, discuss them, and suggest improvements.
    They provide a structured way to manage the integration of changes, ensuring that new code meets the project's standards.
Usage:
    Developers create a pull request on a hosting platform after pushing changes to a feature branch.
    Team members review the changes, discuss them, and may request additional modifications before the changes are merged into the target branch.
Relationship:
    A pull request is typically associated with a branch.
    When you create a pull request, you are proposing to merge the changes from a source branch into a target branch.
    The branch represents the set of changes you've made, while the pull request is a mechanism for proposing those changes for integration.

In summary,
a branch is a way to organize and isolate changes,
while a pull request is a tool for proposing and reviewing changes before they are merged into another branch.
Both are crucial for collaborative development,
allowing teams to work on features independently and integrate changes in a controlled and reviewed manner.
