Question - You need to update your local repos. What git commands will you use?


To update local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository,
we use either git pull or git fetch followed by a merge.

Here are both approaches:
Using git pull:
    git pull origin <branch-name>

    Replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to update.
    For example, if you are working on the "master" branch, you can use:  git pull origin master
    
    This command will fetch the changes from the remote repository and automatically merge them into your current local branch.

Using git fetch and merge:
    git fetch origin <branch-name>
    git merge origin/<branch-name>

    replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to update.
    For the "master" branch, you can use:
    git fetch origin master
    git merge origin/master
    
    This sequence of commands first fetches the changes from the remote repository without merging them.
    Then, it manually merges the changes into your local branch.
    This approach allows you to review the changes before merging.

If you prefer a quick update with automatic merging, use git pull.
If you want more control and prefer to review changes before merging, use git fetch followed by a manual merge.
