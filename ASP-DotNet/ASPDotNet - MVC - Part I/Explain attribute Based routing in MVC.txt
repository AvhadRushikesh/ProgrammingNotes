Question - Explain attribute Based Routing in MVC?


Attribute-based routing is a feature in ASP.NET MVC that allows developers to define routes directly on controllers and actions using attributes.
This approach provides a more declarative and fine-grained way to specify how URLs should be mapped to controller actions,
offering greater control and flexibility.
