Question - What is Output caching in MVC? How to Implement it?


Output caching in ASP.NET MVC is a technique that allows you to cache the output of a controller action or an entire page,
so that the same output doesn't need to be generated repeatedly for subsequent requests.
This can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your web application by reducing the computation and data retrieval required for repeated requests.

In MVC, you can implement output caching in various ways:
1. Output Caching for an Entire Action:
    You can apply output caching at the action level by using the OutputCache attribute.
    This attribute can be applied to a controller action to specify how long the output should be cached.
2. Output Caching with VaryByParam:
    You can also vary the output cache by parameters, so that different versions of the output are cached based on different parameter values.
3. Output Caching with VaryByCustom:
    You can use the VaryByCustom property to specify a custom string to vary the cache. 
    You would then need to implement the GetVaryByCustomString method in your Global.asax.cs file to provide a value for the custom string.
4. Programmatic Output Caching:
    You can also perform programmatic output caching within your action method using the OutputCache class.
