Question - What are the types of Authentication in ASP.NET MVC?


1. Forms Authentication:
    Uses HTML forms to collect user credentials (e.g., username and password).

2. Windows Authentication:
    Relies on the Windows operating system for authentication.
    Users are authenticated based on their Windows credentials.

3. OAuth and OpenID Connect:
    Standardized protocols for third-party authentication.
    Allows users to log in using credentials from external identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

4. Token-based Authentication:
    Involves the use of tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), for authentication.
    Tokens are issued upon successful authentication and are included in subsequent requests for authorization.
    Stateless and scalable, suitable for use in Web APIs.

5. Cookie Authentication:
    Uses cookies to persist authentication information.
    A cookie is issued to the client upon successful authentication, and subsequent requests include the cookie for authentication.

6. API Key Authentication:
    Involves the use of API keys for authenticating requests to an API.
    Each client is assigned a unique API key that must be included in the request headers.
    Suitable for securing Web APIs.
    
7. External Authentication (Social Logins):
    Allows users to log in using accounts from external identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft). 
    Reduces the need for users to create new accounts for each application.
