Question - What is Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET MVC?


Authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts in web application security.
They work together to ensure that users can access only the resources and functionalities for which they have proper permissions.

Authentication:
    is the process of verifying the identity of a user, ensuring that the user is who they claim to be.
    In the context of ASP.NET MVC, authentication is typically performed by validating user credentials, such as a username and password.

Authorization:
    is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a requested action or access a specific resource.
    It defines what actions a user is allowed to take after their identity has been confirmed through authentication.
