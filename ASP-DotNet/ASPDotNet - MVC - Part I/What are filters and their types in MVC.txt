Question - What are the Filters and their types in MVC?


In ASP.NET MVC,
filters are attributes or classes that provide a way to add pre-processing and post-processing logic to controller actions and other MVC components.
Filters are executed before or after the execution of an action,
allowing developers to modify the behavior of an action or handle cross-cutting concerns.

1. Authorization Filters:
    Execute before the action method is invoked.
    Control access to the action based on user roles, permissions, or other criteria.
2. Action Filters:
    Execute before and after the execution of an action.
    Useful for logging, caching, or modifying the action's result.
3. Result Filters:
    Execute before and after the execution of the action result.
    Useful for modifying the result generated by the action.
4. Exception Filters:
    Execute when an unhandled exception occurs during the execution of an action.
    Useful for logging, handling, or custom error responses.
5. Resource Filters:
    Execute before and after resource filters and can perform tasks such as caching.
    Rarely used compared to other filter types.
6. Global Filters:
    Applied globally to all controllers and actions in the application.
