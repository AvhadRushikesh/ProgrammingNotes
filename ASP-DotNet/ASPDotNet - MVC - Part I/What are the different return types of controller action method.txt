Question - What are the different return types of a Controller Action Method?


In ASP.NET MVC,
controller action methods return different types, 
each indicating how the result of the action should be processed and presented to the user.

1. ViewResult:
    Represents HTML and markup.
    Used when rendering a view.
    Typically returned by actions responsible for displaying web pages.
    
    public IActionResult MyView()
    {
        return View():
    }

2. PartialViewResult:
    Represents HTML and markup, similar to ViewResult.
    Returned by actions that render a partial view.
    
    public IActionResult MyPartialView()
    {
        return PartialView();
    }

3. JsonResult:
    Represents JSON-formatted data.
    Used when returning data for AJAX requests or other scenarios requiring JSON.
    Commonly returned by actions serving as API endpoints.

    public IActionResult MyJasonAction()
    {
        var data = new { Name = “John”, Age = 30 };
        return Json(data);
    }

4. ContentResult:
    Represents a raw string content.
    Used to return plain text or custom content types.
    
    public IActionResult MyTextResult()
    {
        return Content(“Hello, World!”, “text/plain”);
    }

5.RedirectResult:
    Represents a redirection to a different URL.
    Used to perform client-side redirection.
    Commonly returned after form submissions or actions that require a redirect.
    
    public IActionResult MyRedirectAction()
    {
        return Redirect(“/Home/Index”);
    }

 6. RedirectToActionResult:
    Represents a redirection to another action within the same controller or a different controller.
    Used for redirecting to a named action.
    Provides a more type-safe way to specify the target action.
    
    public IActionResult MyRedirectAction()
    {
        return RedirectToAction(“Index”, “Home”);
    }

7. FileResult:
    Represents a binary file result.
    Used to return files for download.
    Allows specifying the file content, MIME type, and file download name.
    
    public IActionResult DownloadFile()
    {
        byte[] fileContent = /* Load file content */;
        return File(fileContents, “application/octet-stram”, “FileName.ext”);
    } 

8. NotFoundResult:
    Represents an HTTP 404 Not Found response.
    Used when the requested resource is not found.
    Signifies that the requested page or resource is not available.
    
    public IActionResult NotFoundAction()
    {
        return NotFound();
    } 

9. StatusCodeResult:
    Represents an HTTP response with a specific status code.
    Used to return a custom HTTP status code and an optional reason phrase.
    
    public IActionResult MyCustomStatus()
    {
       return StatusCode(403, “Access Forbidden”);
    }
