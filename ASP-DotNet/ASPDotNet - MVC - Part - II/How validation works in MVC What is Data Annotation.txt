Question - How Validation works in MVC? What is Data Annotation?


In ASP.NET MVC, validation is the process of ensuring that user input meets specified criteria before it is processed by the application.
Validation helps in preventing invalid or malicious data from being submitted and processed.
There are various mechanisms for performing validation in MVC, and one of the commonly used techniques is through Data Annotations.

Data Annotations for Validation:
    Data Annotations are attributes applied to model properties to specify validation rules.
    These attributes are part of the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace and provide a declarative way to define validation constraints.

How Validation Works in MVC:
User Input: 
    User input is submitted through an HTML form.
Model Binding: 
    The MVC framework binds the user input to the corresponding properties of the model.
Validation: 
    Validation rules specified using Data Annotations are applied during the model binding process.
    If validation fails, the ModelState is updated with error messages.
ModelState: 
    The ModelState object contains information about model state, including validation errors.
    If there are validation errors, the controller can handle them and return the user to the form with error messages.
Displaying Errors in the View: 
    In the view, error messages can be displayed using the Html.ValidationMessageFor helper method
