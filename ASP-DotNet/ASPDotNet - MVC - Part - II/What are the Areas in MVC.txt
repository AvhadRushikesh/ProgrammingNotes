Question - What are the Areas in MVC?


In ASP.NET MVC, an "Area" is a way to organize a large MVC web application into smaller, more manageable sections.
Areas provide a means to structure an application into distinct functional modules or feature sets.
Each area can have its own controllers, views, models, and other resources, allowing for better organization and separation of concerns in large applications.

Key features of MVC Areas:
Organizational Structure: 
    Areas allow you to create a hierarchical structure within your MVC project,
    making it easier to manage and navigate as the application grows. 
    Each area typically represents a self-contained module or feature of the application.
Separation of Concerns:
    Areas support the principle of separation of concerns by allowing you to group related controllers, views, and models together within a designated area. 
    This separation helps maintain a clean and modular codebase.
Controller Namespace:
    Each area has its own namespace for controllers.
    This allows controllers with the same name to exist in different areas without conflicts. 
    For example, if you have an "Admin" area and a "Public" area, both can have a HomeController without conflicting.
View Folder Structure:
    Areas have their own Views folder, enabling the organization of views specific to that area.
    The view folders within each area can have the same structure (e.g., "Shared" for shared views), providing a consistent organization pattern.
Registration in RouteConfig: 
    Areas need to be registered in the RouteConfig file to inform the application about their existence.
    The AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas() method is typically called in the Application_Start method in the Global.asax.cs file.
Accessing Areas:
    URLs for controllers within areas include the area name in the route.
    For example, if you have an area named "Admin," the URL might look like "/Admin/Home/Index."
Visual Studio Template: 
    When you create a new ASP.NET MVC project in Visual Studio, it often includes the default "Areas" folder structure with an "AreaRegistration.cs" file, demonstrating how to define and register areas.

Here's a basic example of how you might define an area:
    Create a new folder named "Areas" in your project.
    Inside the "Areas" folder, create a subfolder for your area, for example, "Admin."
    Inside the "Admin" folder, create controllers, views, and models specific to the "Admin" area.
    Create an "AreaRegistration.cs" file inside the "Admin" folder to define and register the area.
