Question - What is the difference between ViewData, ViewBag & TempData?


In ASP.NET MVC, ViewData, ViewBag, and TempData are mechanisms for passing data from controllers to views. 
While they serve similar purposes, there are differences in their usage, lifespan, and underlying implementations.

ViewData:
    Type: 
        ViewData is a Dictionary<string, object> property of the ControllerBase class.
    Purpose: 
        It is used to pass data from a controller to a view.
    Lifespan: 
        The data stored in ViewData persists only for the current request.
        It is suitable for passing data between the controller and its associated view during the same request-response cycle.

ViewBag:
    Type: 
        ViewBag is a dynamic property of the ControllerBase class.
    Purpose:
        It is another mechanism for passing data from a controller to a view.
    Lifespan:
        Like ViewData, the data stored in ViewBag persists only for the current request.
        It is suitable for passing data between the controller and its associated view during the same request-response cycle.

TempData:
    Type:
        TempData is a Dictionary<string, object> property of the ControllerBase class.
    Purpose: 
        It is designed for scenarios where you need to persist data between two successive requests.
        It is often used for scenarios like redirects where data needs to be passed from the current request to the next.
    Lifespan:
        The data stored in TempData persists for the current and the next request.
        After the second request, the data is automatically cleared.
        It uses session state or cookies (depending on configuration) to store the data temporarily.
