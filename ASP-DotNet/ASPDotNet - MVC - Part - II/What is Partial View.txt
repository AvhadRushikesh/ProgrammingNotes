Question - What is Partial view?


A Partial View in ASP.NET MVC is a reusable and self-contained view that can be rendered within another view.
It allows you to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, modular components, making the code more maintainable and promoting code reuse. 
Partial Views are similar to regular views, but they are designed to be embedded or included within other views.
