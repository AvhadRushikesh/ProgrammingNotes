Question - How can we pass the data from Controller to View in MVC?


In ASP.NET MVC, data can be passed from a controller to a view using various mechanisms.

1. ViewData: 
    ViewData is a dictionary-like object that allows you to pass data between a controller and a view.
    It uses a key-value pair mechanism to store and retrieve data.

2. ViewBag:
    ViewBag is a dynamic property that uses the ExpandoObject class to store data.
    It is similar to ViewData but provides a more dynamic syntax.

3. Model: 
    The most common and recommended way is to use a strongly-typed model.
    Create a model class and pass an instance of that model to the view.

4. TempData: 
    TempData is a dictionary-like object that can be used to store data for the duration of an HTTP request (including redirects).
    
5. Strongly-Typed View:
    When using a strongly-typed model, the view can access the model directly.
