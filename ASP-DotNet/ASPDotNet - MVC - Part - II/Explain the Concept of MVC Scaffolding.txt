Question - Explain the concept of MVC Scaffolding?


MVC Scaffolding is a code generation framework in ASP.NET MVC that automates the creation of CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a model. 
It is a powerful tool that accelerates the development of web applications by generating standard controller actions, views, and related files 
based on the model's structure.
