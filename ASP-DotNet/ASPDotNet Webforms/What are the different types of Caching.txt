Question - What are the different types of Caching?


In ASP.NET Web Forms, 
caching is a technique used to store and retrieve frequently used data or content in a way that improves the performance and responsiveness of web applications. 

1. Output Caching: 
    Caches the entire output HTML of a page.
2. Fragment Caching: 
    Caches a specific portion or fragment of a page.
3. Data Caching: 
    Caches data objects, such as datasets or custom objects, in memory.
4. Object Caching: 
    Caches objects in memory for reuse across multiple requests.
5. SQL Cache Dependency: 
    Caches data based on changes in a SQL Server database.
6. Donut Hole Caching: 
    Similar to fragment caching but allows dynamic content within a cached fragment.
7. Custom Caching: 
    Implement custom caching mechanisms tailored to specific application requirements.
