Question - What is the Difference between Server.Transfer() and Response.Redirect()?


Server.Transfer() and Response.Redirect() are both methods in ASP.NET used for navigation between web pages.

Server.Transfer():
Server-Side Transfer: 
    The transfer is handled on the server side.
No Round-Trip to the Client: 
    The browser is not involved in the transfer.
    It's a server-side operation, and the client is not aware of it.
Single Request-Response: 
    It's a single request-response between the client and the server.
URL in the Browser Does Not Change: 
    The URL in the browser remains the same;
    the client is not aware that it has been transferred to another page on the server.
Better Performance: 
    Generally, Server.Transfer() is considered more efficient as it avoids a round-trip to the client.
Example:
    Server.Transfer("newPage.aspx"); 

Response.Redirect():
Client-Side Redirect: 
    The client is sent a response with a status code (302 - Found) and a new URL to which the client should navigate.
Round-Trip to the Client: 
    The browser is involved, and there is a round-trip between the client and the server.
Two Request-Response Cycles: 
    It involves two separate request-response cycles: one for the original request and one for the redirected request.
URL in the Browser Changes: 
    The URL in the browser changes to the new URL specified in Response.Redirect().
Slower Performance: 
    Since it involves a round-trip to the client, it is generally considered to have slightly slower performance than Server.Transfer().
Example:
    Response.Redirect("newPage.aspx"); 

In summary, 
if you want to perform a server-side transfer without involving the client, you might prefer Server.Transfer().
If you need to redirect the client to a different page and have the URL change in the browser, you would use Response.Redirect().
