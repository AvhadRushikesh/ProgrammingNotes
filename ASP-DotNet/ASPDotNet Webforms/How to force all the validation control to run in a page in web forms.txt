Question - How to force all the validation control to run in a page in web forms?


In ASP.NET Web Forms, you can force all validation controls on a page to run validation by calling the Page.Validate() method.
This method triggers the validation process for all validation controls on the page.
After calling Page.Validate(), you can check the Page.IsValid property to determine if all validations passed.


Here's an example of how you can force all validation controls to run in a page:

protected void btnSubmit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Force validation for all controls on the page
    Page.Validate();

    // Check if all validations passed
    if (Page.IsValid)
    {
        // Your code to handle the form submission when validations pass
        // This block will only be executed if all validations are successful
    }
    else
    {
        // Validation failed, handle accordingly (e.g., display error messages)
    }
}

In this example:
The Page.Validate() method is called to initiate the validation process for all validation controls on the page.

The Page.IsValid property is then checked.
If it returns true, it means that all validations passed, and you can proceed with the form submission logic.

If Page.IsValid returns false,
it means that at least one validation failed.
You can handle this situation by displaying error messages or taking appropriate actions based on your application's requirements.
