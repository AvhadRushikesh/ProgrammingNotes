Question - What are the events in page life cycle? In which event the controls loaded?


The Page Life Cycle in ASP.NET Web Forms defines a series of events that occur from the initialization of a page to its rendering and unloading.

1. Page Initialization (Init):
    The Init event is the first event in the page life cycle.
    During this event, the page and its controls are initialized.
    Accessing controls in this event ensures they are available for subsequent events.
2. Load ViewState (LoadViewState):
    This event is triggered to load the view state of the page and its controls.
    The view state is the mechanism used to persist the state of controls across postbacks.
3. Page Load (Load):
    The Load event is raised for the page and its controls.
    This is a critical event where developers often place code to initialize or populate controls.
    It occurs after the Init event and before any control events (e.g., button click events).
4. Postback Event Handling:
    If the request is a postback (e.g., a button click), the corresponding control events are processed.
5. Page Load (Load) (continued):
    The Load event is raised again after postback event processing.
    Additional processing can be done based on the postback data.
6. Load Complete (LoadComplete):
    The LoadComplete event is raised after all postback events and processing are complete.
    This is a suitable place for finalizing activities related to the page load.
7. PreRender (PreRender):
    The PreRender event is triggered just before rendering the page.
    It is often used for final modifications to controls before rendering.
8. Save ViewState (SaveViewState):
    This event is raised to save the view state of the page and its controls.
    The view state is persisted to be sent to the client for the next postback.
9. Render (Render):
    The Render event is where the page's HTML is generated.
    Custom rendering logic can be implemented during this event.
10. Unload (Unload):
    The Unload event is the last event in the page life cycle.
    It occurs after the page has been fully rendered, and resources are released.
    During this event, you should release any resources acquired during the page's lifespan.


Controls Loaded:
    The controls are loaded during the Init event of the page life cycle.
    This is the earliest stage where you can access and interact with the controls on the page.
    The Init event ensures that controls are initialized and their properties are set,
    making them ready for subsequent events in the life cycle.
